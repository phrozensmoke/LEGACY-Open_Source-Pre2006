[PHTITLE]CONJUGATE HELP

Click the [PH-HI]'Conjugate'[/PH-HI] tab.

[PHSECTION]SAVE TO FILE:
The [PH-HI]'Save To File'[/PH-HI] feature is a quick and easy way to save your verb conjugations and translations to a plain text file.  Simply click the [PH-HI]'Save To File'[/PH-HI] button, select a file name to save to, and click [PH-HI]'Ok'[/PH-HI].  Your verb conjugation and translation information for the select verb will be saved for your future reference.

[PHSECTION]SEARCH-ON-DEMAND:
With the [PH-HI]'Search-On-Demand'[/PH-HI] feature enabled, Pythoñol's conjugation and translation abilities are greatly increased.  It is recommened that you leave the 'Search-On-Demand' feature enabled (or checked) to take advantage of Pythoñol's full capabilities.  With 'Search-On-Demand' enabled, it is possible to conjugate Spanish verbs which are NOT in their infinitive form.  In addition, if the term you enter cannot be conjugated as a Spanish verb, Pythoñol will allow you to chose a verb from the best matches in the dictionary, making real-time English-to-Spanish translation possible.  Without the 'Search-On-Demand' feature enabled, only Spanish verb infinitives can be conjugated, and the dictionary is not searched if the term you enter cannot be conjugated as a Spanish verb.

[PHSECTION]VERB FAMILY:
Sometimes, a Spanish verb may be part of a [PH-HI]'verb family'[/PH-HI].  A [PH-HI]'verb family'[/PH-HI] is a group of Spanish verbs which are all either conjugated according to a common conjugation rule, or have related meanings.  For example, the verbs 'conocer' and 'desconocer' are conjugated according to a common conjugation rule and have meanings which are related to one another.  Clicking the 'Verb Family' button will show the 'verb family' for the current verb, if such a 'family' does exist for that verb.

[PHSECTION]VERB FIELD:
The [PH-HI]'Verb:'[/PH-HI] text field is where you type in the verb or term you wish to have conjugated (and translated).  You can also select previously used verbs and terms from the drop-down list.  The drop-down list stores a 'history' of up to 30 previously used verbs and terms.

[PHSECTION]CONJUGATE BUTTON:
Clicking the [PH-HI]'CONJUGATE!'[/PH-HI] button tells Pythoñol to attempt to conjugate and translate the verb or term you have entered in the [PH-HI]'Verb:'[/PH-HI] field (described above).

[PHSECTION]SPANISH LETTERS TOOLBAR:
The [PH-HI]Spanish Letters Toolbar[/PH-HI] contains several commonly-used, accented Spanish letters, not generally found on standard American keyboards.  Clicking one of the letters on the Spanish Letters Toolbar will insert that accented letter into the [PH-HI]'Verb:'[/PH-HI] text field at the cursor position.  This feature has been provided to help eliminate the need for an external 'character map' application.

[PHSECTION]CONJUGATING A VERB OR TERM:
The steps to conjugating a verb or term are very simple:

1.  Type in the verb or term you wish to have conjugated and translated into the [PH-HI]'Verb:'[/PH-HI] text field, or select a previously used verb or term from the drop-down list.

2.  Use the [PH-HI]Spanish Letters Toolbar[/PH-HI], as needed, to insert accented Spanish letters into the [PH-HI]'Verb:'[/PH-HI] text field.

3.  Make sure that [PH-HI]'Search-On-Demand'[/PH-HI] is checked (recommended).  If you know that the verb you have entered is a Spanish infinitive and do not want the dictionary searched (as-needed), leave  [PH-HI]'Search-On-Demand'[/PH-HI] unchecked.

4.  Click the [PH-HI]'CONJUGATE!'[/PH-HI] button.   If you verb was able to be immediately conjugated as-is, the appropriate conjugations and translations will appear immediately in the window.  Otherwise, a couple self-explanatory, assistive dialog boxes may appear to provide help in conjugating your verb or term.  If conjugation and translation failed completely, an error message will appear in the window.

5.  If you wish to [PH-HI]save[/PH-HI] the conjugations and translations for this verb to a file, click the [PH-HI]'Save To File'[/PH-HI] button, enter a file name, and click [PH-HI]'Ok'[/PH-HI].  Your verb conjugation and translation information for the selected verb will be saved for your future reference.

6.  If you are running a Linux/Unix version of Pythoñol, and have an LRPng/LPR-based spooler system on your computer, you may [PH-HI]print[/PH-HI] the results by clicking [PH-HI]'File' -> 'Print...'[/PH-HI] on the Pythoñol main menu.  (Sorry, Windows users!)   See [PH-HI]'Help' --> 'Help...'[/PH-HI] on the menu for more information on printing in Pythoñol.

If you have the [PH-HI]Festival text-to-speech[/PH-HI] extension installed and usable, you may hear the words pronounced by clicking the light blue [PH-HI]'Play'[/PH-HI] button, generally located to the left of your screen.  Click [PH-HI]'Help' -> 'Festival Text-to-Speech Help...'[/PH-HI] on the menu for more information.
