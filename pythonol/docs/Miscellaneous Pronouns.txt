Remember that the pronoun forms referring to people [such as 'alguien' and 'nadie'] require the use of the personal 'a' when occurring as the direct object of a verb. Also keep in mind the rule for forming negative sentences: one negative word must occur in front of the verb (others may follow the verb).
