[PHTITLE]LINKED VERBS

[PHSECTION]What are Linked Verbs?
	Linked verbs are verbs linked to either a present participle (the "-ing" gerundio "-ndo"), an infinitive, or a preposition + an infinitive. This happens frequently in Spanish, and only the first of the two verbs may be conjugated.  However, the second verb may be an infinitive or aan "-ing" (-ndo form).

[PHSECTION]There are a few generalizations about linked verbs: 

  1. Verbs meaning 'to begin' and verbs of movement towards someplace or goal are normally followed by 'a' + [infinitive]. 
  2. Verbs meaning 'to stop' or 'to finish' are normally followed by 'de' + [infinitive]. 
  3. Words such as 'could', 'should', and 'may' are normally followed by an infinitive with NO intervening preposition. 
  4. Verbs meaning 'to continue' are normally followed by the -ndo form ("-ing"), with NO preposition. 

[PHSECTION]LINKED VERBS LIST:
Below is a list of linked verbs, divided into 9 distinct sections.  It is well worth your time to familiarize yourself with these linked verbs and their meanings, and, perhaps, even memorize them.  Note:  Information in parenthesis next to a Spanish infinitive indicates that the verb is a stem-changing verb  (i.e.,   '(ie)', '(ue)' ).  Remember, only the FIRST verb in a linked verb is conjugated.
