If you have the [PH-HI]Festival text-to-speech extension[/PH-HI] installed and usable, you may hear the words pronounced by clicking the light blue [PH-HI]'Play'[/PH-HI] button, generally located to the left of your screen.  Click [PH-HI]'Help' -> 'Festival Text-to-Speech Help...'[/PH-HI] on the menu for more information.
