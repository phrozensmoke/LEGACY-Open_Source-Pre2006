[PHTITLE]PAST PERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE TENSE

[PH-HI] The Past Perfect Subjunctive may be used to indicate an action or state that occurred prior to something in the past (usually expressed by the imperfect or preterit indicative, or by the past subjunctive).  The past perfect subjunctive is formed by using the imperfect subjunctive of the helping verb 'haber' with the past participle:[/PH-HI] 

	hubiera / hubieras / hubiera / hubiéramos / hubierais / hubieran   + past participle


[PH-HI]Use Past Perfect Subjunctive when discussing situations in the past that are contrary to the fact:[/PH-HI] 

	Si hubiera ido a la fiesta, habría visto a Isabel.  (If I had gone to the party, I would have seen Isabel.)
	Dudábamos que hubieran llegado.  (We doubted that they had come.)
