[PHTITLE]TRANSLATE HELP

The [PH-HI]'Translate'[PH-HI] component (known as [PH-HI]PyBabelPhish[/PH-HI]) is for translating entire phrases and sentences through one of the available online translation services, such as BabelFish or Google.  [PH-HI]NOTE: The 'Translate' feature requires a working internet connection in order to properly function.[/PH-HI]

Click the [PH-HI]'Translate'[/PH-HI] tab.


[PHSECTION]TEXT TO TRANSLATE:
The [PH-HI]'Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] text field is where you type in the phrases or sentences you wish to have translated.  You may also [PH-HI]paste[/PH-HI] in the text, or [PH-HI]drag and drop[/PH-HI] a text file onto the [PH-HI]'Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] box.

[PHSECTION]SPANISH LETTERS TOOLBAR:
The [PH-HI]Spanish Letters Toolbar[/PH-HI] contains several commonly-used, accented Spanish letters, not generally found on standard American keyboards.  Clicking one of the letters on the [PH-HI]Spanish Letters Toolbar[/PH-HI] will insert that accented letter into the [PH-HI]'Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] text field at the cursor position.  This feature has been provided to help eliminate the need for an external 'character map' application.

[PHSECTION]LANGUAGE:
Use the [PH-HI]'Language:'[/PH-HI] menu to select the appropriate language pair for the translation you are about to retrieve.  For example, if the text you entered in [PH-HI]'Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] is in English, and you need a Spanish translation, select the menu option 'English to Spanish'.  Likewise, if the text you entered in '[PH-HI]Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] is in Spanish, and you need an English translation, select the menu option 'Spanish to English'.

[PHSECTION]TRANSLATE:
Clicking the [PH-HI]'Translate!'[/PH-HI] button tells PyBabelPhish to retrieve a translation for the phrases or sentences you entered in the [PH-HI]'Text to translate'[/PH-HI] field (described above).  PyBabelPhish will display the translation in the window just below the [PH-HI]'Translate!'[/PH-HI] button (in the 'Translation:' window), or will display an error message if it was unable to retrieve a translation.

[PHSECTION]SAVE:
The [PH-HI]'Save'[/PH-HI] feature is a quick and easy way to save retrieved translations to a plain text file.  Both the retrieved translation and the text you entered in [PH-HI]'Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] will be saved in the file.  Simply click the [PH-HI]'Save'[/PH-HI] button, select a file name to save to, and click [PH-HI]'Ok'[/PH-HI].  The translation will be saved to file for your future reference.

[PHSECTION]ABOUT:
Click the [PH-HI]'About'[/PH-HI] button for more information, such as the license and copyright, on the the translation component, PyBabelPhish.

[PHSECTION]TRANSLATION:
The [PH-HI]'Translation:'[/PH-HI] window displays any retrieved translations or error messages.  If you see repeated error messages indicating that a translation could not be retrieved, make sure that you have a working internet connection and that you are currently connected to the internet.  In addition, you may want to try selecting a new [PH-HI]'Translation Service'[/PH-HI] (see below).


[PHSECTION]['Settings' Menu]
[PH-HI]'Change Translation Service...' :[/PH-HI]
	Click [PH-HI]'Change Translation Service...'[/PH-HI] on the [PH-HI]'Settings'[/PH-HI] menu to select the translation service you wish to use.  The translation service chosen here will be used for retrieving translations in both the [PH-HI]'Translate'[/PH-HI] section and the [PH-HI]'Translation Exercise'[/PH-HI] section.  It is a good idea to change the selected 'Translation Service' if you are receiving repeated error messages indicating that a translation could not be retrieved, or if you feel that you are receiving too many errors in the translations being retrieved.



[PHSECTION]TRANSLATING PHRASES OR SENTENCES:
The steps for translating phrases and sentences are very simple:

1.  Type in the phrases or sentences you wish to have translated into the [PH-HI]'Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] text field.  You may also [PH-HI]paste[/PH-HI] in the text, or [PH-HI]drag and drop[/PH-HI] a text file onto the [PH-HI]'Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] window.

2.  Use the [PH-HI]Spanish Letters Toolbar[/PH-HI], as needed, to insert accented Spanish letters into the [PH-HI]'Text to translate:'[/PH-HI] text field.

3.  Select the appropriate language pair for the text entered in Step #1 by selecting the correct option from the [PH-HI]'Language:'[/PH-HI] menu.  For example, if the text you entered in 'Text to translate:' is in English, and you need a Spanish translation, select the menu option 'English to Spanish'.

4.  Click the [PH-HI]'Translate!'[/PH-HI] button.   Any retrieved translations (or error messages) will be displayed in the [PH-HI]'Translation:'[/PH-HI] window.

5.  If you wish to save your retrieved translation to a file, click the [PH-HI]'Save To File'[/PH-HI] button, enter a file name, and click [PH-HI]'Ok'[/PH-HI].  Your translation will be saved for your future reference.

6.  If you are running a Linux/Unix version of Pythoñol, and have an LRPng/LPR-based spooler system on your computer, you may [PH-HI]print[/PH-HI] the results by clicking [PH-HI]'File' -> 'Print...'[/PH-HI] on the Pythoñol main menu.  (Sorry, Windows users!)   See [PH-HI]'Help' --> 'Help...'[/PH-HI] on the menu for more information on printing in Pythoñol.

If you have the [PH-HI]Festival text-to-speech[/PH-HI] extension installed and usable, you may hear the words pronounced by clicking the light blue [PH-HI]'Play'[/PH-HI] button, generally located to the left of your screen.  Click [PH-HI]'Help' -> 'Festival Text-to-Speech Help...'[/PH-HI] on the menu for more information.
