Pythonol VERSION 2.1 CHANGES  (1/20/2004):

	- Critical Update: Installation fix for packages using the PyInstallShield installer: A bug resulting from an unneeded 'import GTK' call which could cause installations to completely fail has been fixed.  
	- Critical Update: If you are currently using a child-friendly version of Pythoñol 2.0, you should upgrade immediately to version 2.1 or higher, as version 2.0 has a bug which allows 'inappropriate' content into the databases.  This problem has been fixed in version 2.1, and my apologies to anyone inconvenienced by this problem. All known 'adult'  content has been quarantined to the 'mature' database, as it should be.
	- Critical Update: Pythonol has been upgraded to use PySQLite version 0.5.0 and SQLite version 2.8.8, this has brought some speed improvements, and most certainly adds more stability to the database layer of the application.  Users who need to recompile the PySQLite module used by Pythonol will need to make sure they compile against SQLite 2.8.8 (exactly)
	- Critical Bug Fix: Fixed bugs in the Idioms lister and the Verb Browers which could inadvertently send a very memory-intensive 'cross join' query to the underlying SQLite databases
	- Major Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where the 'Translate' module (PyBabelPhish) might refuse to retrieve translations when running on non-Linux/Unix systems such as Windows and Mac OS X.
	- Portability improvements: Several compatibility changes have been made to support Python 2.3 as well as Python 2.2
	- Portability improvements: Several compatibility changes have been made to improve support for running Pythonol on Windows, and now, Mac OS X (though the application could not be tested on Mac OS X, changes suggested from Mac OS X users were implemented.)
	- Pythonol is now known to run on the Mac OS X operating system, and a new Windows .exe is available for this release
	- A bug which could lead to 'unknown encoding' warnings on the console has been fixed. 
	- User Interface enhancement: Icons on the buttons in the application now use Gtk stock icons, instead of external pixmaps
	- User Interface enhancement: Gtk stock icons have been added to all menus and dialog messages
	- Cleanups: Many duplicates have been removed from the global dictionaries, and the mature content dictionary
	- Improved searching: Searching for one database has been improved by eliminating the 'blob' in the database and replacing it with a 'varchar' column.
	- Help animations: All help animations have been redone; The animations are cleaner, up-to-date, and in .png format instead of .jpg;  In addition, the sizes of the animation frames is now normalized (scaled to a uniform size), and animations now completely fill they animation window (UI improvement); The rate of animation has been slowed down a little to accomodate slower readers
	- Animated help is now enabled on non-Linux/Unix systems such as Windows and OS X, provided the GdkPixbuf and LibPng libraries are properly installed
	- User interface improvements have been made to the 'Search' window that pops up from the 'Conjugate' module; search results should be a little easier to read and scroll through
	- Translation Exercise updates: Many new translatable sentences have been added to the beginner, mid-level, and advanced translation exercises.
	- User interface improvements have been made to the 'Translation' Exercise: the interface is cleaner and uses alot less screen space (this should help lower resolution users)
	- The Thesaurus module now generally returns a few more matches when searching the Thesaurus
	- External pixmaps have been removed from the Spanish Letters Toolbar (regular character Labels are now used), and a new 'Clear All Text' button has been added to the toolbar which clears all the text from the associated text entry or text box.
	- Theme support added: Click 'Settings'-> 'Appearance...' on the menu to manage the theme and font;  This makes it easier for Windows and Mac OS X users to manage the appearance of Pythonol, and users of all operating systems can simply copy or link their favorite Gtk-2 themes into the ./theme/gtk/ subdirectory.  (Many themes require 'theme engines'; these are already included in the Windows .exe binary, and other users can easily find and compile them for their system.).  Pythonol now applys themes on ALL operating systems, not just Windows/non-Linux systems.
	- Bug fix: Preferences saving on Windows: Pythonol will now try to save the preferences file in the directory specified in the environment variable 'WINDIR' if the environment variable 'HOME' does not exist.
	- Bug Fix: Encoding specifications have been added to all python modules to prevent the warning on the console about 'unknown encoding' when running Pythonol on Python version 2.3
	- The application's copyright has been updated to accomodate the New Year
	


PyBabelPhish VERSION 2.1 CHANGES  (1/20/2004):

	- Major Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where the application might refuse to retrieve translations when running on non-Linux/Unix systems such as Windows and Mac OS X.
	- User interface improvements: Gtk stock icons have been added to all buttons, dialogs, and menus.
	- The language selection menu is now wider, for easier reading.  
	- The 'set_usize' call for the window size has been removed, as it may have caused problems for some users.
	- All translations services have been re-checked (all are known to be still working properly).
	- Theme support added: Click 'File'-> 'Settings...' on the menu to manage the theme and font;  This makes it easier for Windows and Mac OS X users to manage the appearance of PyBabelPhish, and users of all operating systems can simply copy or link their favorite Gtk-2 themes into the ./theme/gtk/ subdirectory.  (Many themes require 'theme engines'; these are already included in the Windows .exe binary, and other users can easily find and compile them for their system.)  PyBabelPhish now applys themes on ALL operating systems, not just Windows/non-Linux systems.
	- PyBabelPhish is now known to run on the Mac OS X operating system, and a new Windows .exe is available for this release (bundled with Pythonol)
	- External pixmaps have been removed from the Spanish Letters Toolbar (regular character Labels are now used), and a new 'Clear All Text' button has been added to the toolbar which clears all the text from the associated text entry or text box.
	- Bug Fix: Encoding specifications have been added to all python modules to prevent the warning on the console about 'unknown encoding' when running Pythonol on Python version 2.3
