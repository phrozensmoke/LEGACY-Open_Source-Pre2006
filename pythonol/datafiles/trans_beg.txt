The thing unrolled, it expanded and expanded.
And it seemed to me that one of these had moved.
But wait! There was something new under the tree.
Briefly, it informed me that Mr.
They've already walked.
I forgive him his mistakes.
They paid him this salary.
Buddy had already read.
Mark had worked for two or three months.
David lent her a lot of money.
Those farmers gave him a book.
Those plumbers jog.
Donna's daughter talked.
Those singers ate.
That dentist tells them many lies.
That news announcer told her the shortest way.
I teach them English.
I had been talking but I was dancing.
Glenn had already shaved.
Those barbers swam.
That computer programmer drives.
Those barbers slept.
That bus driver jogged.
Everything is different - everything.
I remember the occasion with extreme vividness.
But it was perhaps necessary we should get on.
Well, I wasn't going to walk the plank, anyhow.
I'm getting out." "You can't," he said.
Cavor THE two earlier messages of Mr.
I did not touch it, I stood looking at it.
We may find it - certainly we may find it.
But of its feet we saw nothing.
"They seem to be releasing us," said Cavor.
high; he had small slender legs about 18 in.
I made an interrogative noise.
Aladdin now begged to know what he had done.
And ever that shrill piping continued.
There was no way out of it - no way out of it.
Each leap seemed to last ages.
I returned to my scenario.
I fell on all fours, and my lungs whooped.
But now that fact insisted on being remembered.
Something held me to the sphere.
I didn't tell Miss Johnson to dance fast.
Are the farmers training Sue to cook?
Matthew wasn't forcing Anthony to work.
I was reminding Peter to study slowly.
Buddy has just persuaded Ms. Brown to dance.
They are telling Sandra to pray nowadays.
Have you expected Marty to eat recently?
Is the farmer forcing Stephen to play?
Has Donna's daughter already danced?
Haven't the barbers already jumped?
Haven't the thieves swum?
I have walked since last night at eleven.
The doctors have danced.
Have you urged Ashley to surf?
Did David allow Eleanor to drive?
Has Marty encouraged Tony to walk?
Joe isn't expecting Joseph to work these days.
You were ordering Lawrence to drive last winter.
She has begged Joe to work all afternoon.
Martha has urged Joe's girlfriend to talk.
"I want help," I said hoarsely.
I don't think I thought clearly then.
The others stood ready to follow after us.
Then he seemed to decide for my reasons.
For some days we received nothing.
The third day he called upon me.
That was my world and the life I was made for.
For an instant it seemed to be extinguished.
He, however, took no notice of her.
Hate all who not draw like him.
"Just lay down there in that cotton", he said.
But he was nowhere to be seen.
Very probably there was.
I had the scenario as good as done.
But now I made it with no effort whatever.
I made a bolt through them into the hotel.
Little drops of moisture flew about.
The water came rippling in in long shallow waves.
We were both very much out of breath.
But it came to me at once - a positive craving.
" We don't quite allow for the gravitation.
"We can't do anything," he said.
"I don't know - the chronometer is broken.
They didn't know what to do with the stuff.
"Cavor!" I cried; but no Cavor was visible.
"It's lead, or gold!" said one.
She must not wake Christopher.
"Yes," I said with emphasis.
I stared at them for a moment, spear in hand.
His answer I did not catch.
.not as a call to battle.
The cabin? They started to run.
I followed him with a beating heart.
It was pale green, deep, and solid.
It was certainly something very gaseous and thin.
It swayed up and down, rocking, rocking.
You haven't married." "Never wanted to.
Imagine him explaining his artist.
"It was an incredible crowd.
"Confound your science!" I said.
I should guard myself against these things.
Cavor confirms me upon all these points.
Cavor least expected it.
He glanced at me with his face distorted.
Well, they must take it as fiction - there it is.
"You know you're not a practical man.
"Gold, right enough," said the third.
So we clambered back into the sunlight.
We are in a little universe of our own.
Gone in the shadows of night.
The thing was exasperating - it was absurd.
Of a certainty it came from below.
Its cliff-like walls closed us in on every side.
Eleanor dances.
Roger's father skied.
That student shaves.
Those scientists jog.
Those librarians sing.
Those news announcers danced.
That taxi driver prays.
They fed the baby.
I shot a gun.
Those carpenters played the organ.
They stole money.
Sandra painted the door.
Rita's aunt worked.
They skied.
Those bankers steal things.
I play basketball.
At first I could not believe it.
Every one must have been taking the thing in.
He put a dubious hand to his lips.
"I think," he said, "one can get data.
At least she'd slept in long jons.
At the time I thought they were snow.
I saw his face still bore evidences of emotion.
He looked up at me and smiled.
He went towards it and turned.
I've walked past here for years - years.
I went down with Cavor's knees in my chest.
"What is that beyond there?" I asked.
It was like hitting a damp toadstool.
At any rate, that is my interpretation.
She tried to only think how to get home.
It might be they had other surprises for us.
" There must be no shilly-shally.
"Bacon," I whispered, "eggs.
We dare not tempt them with weakness.
The record is indistinct for three words.
Jackie is helpful.
She isn't busy.
Marge hasn't become a thief.
She isn't a student.
He is a lawyer.
I'm not a thief.
Rosie looks quiet.
That dentist takes a test.
I am famous.
They aren't bartenders.
Patty won't become a doctor.
He is sad.
She isn't popular.
I kick a ball.
I caught tigers.
I'm not lucky.
Alfred's niece isn't a flight attendant.
Stephen didn't become a science teacher.
I am a bus driver.
I'm not a flight attendant.
Ms. Brown flew a kite.
Peter throws a ball.
Ginger fed the baby.
They flew a kite.
That science teacher throws a ball.
Bob paints a picture.

I ate some crackers.

That singer jumps.
That science teacher prays.
They ate.
Donna's daughter shouted.
That scientist eats.
Donna's daughter shaves.
Erika had already laughed.
Erika had already talked.
And now, as to the nature of these inquiries.
"I say!" cried the little man.
And Cavor - ? He was already infinite.
He too gesticulated and shouted.
He smiled at them and went back to work.
At last my only care was to get back.
"We are some way in," he said.
Then it had become real and imminent again.
I have extenuated little and suppressed nothing.
And that way lay escape.
I stood in the hollow staring about me.
My eyes went back to the Grand Lunar.
"There is first a little precaution," he said.
Those musicians run.
Lester's ex-wife walked.
That bartender works.
That spy walks.
Those cashiers sang.
Those taxi drivers drive.
Those singers swim.
That janitor laughs.
That carpenter drove.
Those journalists surf.
Those fishermen drive.
That garbage man laughs.
Betsy's nephew laughed.
Those flight attendants slept.
"Confound you! " I cried.
Cavor, we musn't sit here and dream.
Instead I felt - as if I were disembodied.
I am greatly indebted to you.
After a time I felt a little better.
"Good Lord!" I exclaimed.
There wasn't anywhere else to look.
The night was dark and overcast.
Then they unfastened the chains about our waists.
.ask not what your country can do for you.
He searched me with questions.
The man looked at them kindly.
the floor of the giant crater.
Eat little - drink little - draw.
"I'll tell all that later," I said.
One can hypotheticate certain things.
Mercy! at any rate of restraint.
We are lying on a bank of earthy rock.
For an instant I stood transfixed.
For a space the moon world was still.
A question floated up out of the void.
"Are we visible from the earth?" I asked.
My voice sounded like the voice of a lost lamb.
Cindi had known about Santa for a long time now.
I'm a practical man, and you are not.
Over, clutch, bump, clutch, bump, over....
"I am already greatly indebted to you," he said.
"But I'm afraid I should bore you," he said.
I began to stretch my limbs carefully.
Those barbers drink tea.
They take a photograph.
They set an alarm clock.
Jimmy Joe mailed the package.
They read a magazine.
I replaced a fuse.
Those barbers replace a fuse.
Mike wore a hat.
Joe's girlfriend played the organ.
That guard flies a kite.
They fly a kite.
I take a photograph.
Those bartenders washed a car.
Ashley laughed.
Those carpenters pick an orange.
That manager opens a can.
Jordan capped the first half with a flourish.
"The problem is communication.
I put out my hands and straightened my legs.
Remember wonderful more than any.
On my verandah steps he turned.
Whose purposes, what purposes, was I serving? ...
Stumble was more like it.
Even in the shade the rock felt hot.
I intended to rest for only a little while.
There came a little pause.
All my being shrank from that approach.
The great principles of geometry, to begin with.
"I begin to see," I said slowly.
Only - It was not daylight after all.
He wanted to buy me out of my bungalow.
But in this room there were no tiny men.
And I was in it! I took my line straight away.
I rubbed my eyes and stretched my arms.
He buzzed like something electric.
I astonished Cavor at breakfast.
Leap, leap, leap, and each leap was seven ages.
Its that zuzzoo business on a larger scale.
They will accept the cyclone story.
I gasped a painful laugh.
" Go on." "I know that too," he remarked.
I picked up a fragment and sniffed at it.
Porters almost invariably accompany them.
"He was at first perplexed and incredulous.
In another moment we were spun about again.
Then I took deep breaths.
It is no concern of mine.
At last he signed and spoke.
.at home and around the world.
On the blackness - a little touch of blue.
For a minute perhaps it was massacre.
They'll go past." I listened again for a space.
I don't think I have ever had such a night.
"Why have we no chairs? " I asked.
"You are tired," he remarked.
I picked it up, and on it were smears of red.
"My hands! " he answered.
not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need.
An atmosphere had arisen about us.
His arms began to wave in their former fashion.
All the intelligent work was done by Cavor.
"I will own that I am still by no means indurated.
"But this is stupendous!" I said.
Let the word go forth from this time and place.
I picked up jacket and crowbar again.
All things mean nothing to him - only draw.
They slowed to a walk, then a creep.
I perceived I must have slept some time.
" Yes,"I said, "I am hungry.
I could have finished that play.
I was a dozen yards from it.
I made an undecided step back towards the sphere.
They'll - " I didn't finish my sentence.
But no, it wasn't the cabin.
The second came after an interval of a week.
She felt brave and daring doing it.
I got it on a three years' agreement.
I nodded my head in assent to him.
An air-tight manhole is all that is needed.
"It's phosphorescence again!" I said.
.in a new alliance for progress.
Aladdin was so amazed he could not say a word.
He was returning to see why we had not advanced.
It was so pretty - snowy and full of cedars.
"What do you make of it, anyhow?" I asked humbly.
"I've warned you of that.
Confound Cavor! I took a deep breath.
"But do you really think - ?" he said.
Rather, he was self-depreciatory.
At the stile I looked back at his receding figure.
I put my hands to the sides of my mouth.
He sobbed into her parka, "I came to find Santa".
I crouched over and turned to him.
"Look!" whispered Cavor very softly.
At last I struggled to rise.
He sighed and looked about him.
A change in my rhythmic motion awakened me.
Of course there is one thing - " He paused.
"Well?" said Cavor at last.
"Bedford!" as I flew past him.
The card said "To Cindi with love from Santa".
We peered out upon the landscape of the moon.
He had at one bound become remote.
You have been the veterans of creative suffering.
Walker is 10-for-39 in two games.
Then he came forward again.
We struck out through the jungle.
"Bedford! " he cried unavailingly.
I very speedily convinced myself on that point.
It was a feeling of lightness, of unreality.
Then he drew himself together and leapt.
I don't think I finished it - I forget.
He stood for a moment looking this way and that.
For a moment I was sobered.
I stooped to peer closer.
"There may be others less stupid.
"I think," he said slowly, "we left it ...
"What have you done?" cried the Princess.
I was about to reply when he resumed.
I went on with my third egg.
After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace.
He invited me to see those things.
The lunar dawn had hold of us.
On the moon his character seemed to deteriorate.
He was pointing upward over the carcasses.
And with the dying of Bedford - what then? ...
Then Cindi came awake with a start.
One imagines some interruption from without.
"Well?" said Cavor, in the ghost of a voice.
I watched him out of sight.
It was cold and almost dark.
"Good heavens, Cavor! " I cried.
"Bedford!" panted Cavor behind me.
But how?" "That's perfectly easy.
But how can I tell? There is speech.
We spoke In panting, broken sentences.
"I ascended the staircase by jerks.
"No go," I said, "no use.
"You had better take a club," I said.
Yet why there should be nothing is hard to say.
symbolizing an end as well as a beginning.
About us rose a thin anticipatory haze.
And all about him the stupid insects stared...
Possibly I wandered a little from the point.
We were no longer in a void.
There was a warm air blowing up out of the gulf.
I turned the manhole stopper back again.
"'You talk to other?' he asked, watching me.
My forehead was bruised and had bled.
It made me feel that I was lifting a weight.
I don't think - " I stopped.
I can assure you, you're in at a memorable time.
I raised my hat and wished him a good evening.
I do not know how long that drifting took.
"Cavor," I said, "this takes me queerly.
I was answered by a groan.
"Quite correct," he insisted; "quite correct.
"It's near the ebb," said the fat little man.
" Ess'lent discov'ry yours, Cavor,' said I.
I went on with a new twist to my thoughts.
Our guide's expectant figure reappeared.
She was a little afraid of him.
"I will," I chattered in my teeth.
I shoot a rifle.
Erika washed a car.
That librarian rows a boat.
That barber jumped.
Those musicians read.
That librarian read.
Those flight attendants cook.
Those janitors read.
Catherine ate some crackers.
I climbed a ladder.
They are careless.
Joe isn't a gardener.
They aren't journalists.
Swimming in the classroom is bad.
It's not cheap to surf.
Jack won't become a store clerk.
She isn't selfish.
She isn't a computer programmer.
Connie's husband doesn't look quiet.
"Yes," he said at last, "and we don't.
I hesitated, stepped forward, and picked it up.
"I don't think so," he said.
I took two other mouthfuls.
He looked at me doubtfully.
No! But they will examine it.
"Hul-lo, my man! " he said doubtfully.
One distortion was particularly conspicuous.
The chain was twisted round my fist.
"It's like this," he said.
Thereupon he made me desist.
"If they find it," he began, "if they find it ...
But I could hit upon nothing.
"But this -" I craned my neck to see.
I knew it behoved me to drop at once.
But he couldn't be far, could he? She called out.
Clearly they are intelligent and inquisitive.
"Your legs and feet will light us.
I had come upon a brilliant idea.
"This is only the outer crust.
"It's climbable," I said to Cavor.
My eye caught faint pencil marks.
Kwame Brown, a disappointment as the No.
"Perhaps I do, now I come to think of it.
I have a certain dim perception of another method.
Flick! something flew over my head.
Yet the contrast was very marked.
I decided to stop the night there.
Cavor's society I had not foreseen.
Happily this was incorrect.
I felt the compulsion of their eyes intolerably.
All looked peaceful and quiet, and just the same.
I saw the bubbles dancing on the glass above.
Gothard in which he was working.
The three young men accelerated their pace.
Now the trumpet summons us again.
.where the strong are just.
He discovered a new line of possibilities.
We crawled some way before I decided.
I hesitated, the distance seemed enormous.
I turned on the goad-bearer.
I felt an odd stab of emotion.
She thought a bit and decided she better go home.
This is part of the White Man's Burthen.
I made a few vague affirmatives.
It was a most extraordinary pink, a livid magenta.
"I'm Santa Claus", he answered.
"It's a case for holding out," he said.
My mailed hand seemed to go clean through him.
Good toast and good coffee.
He advanced, reassured by that.
"Well?" "I was angry at the time.
All that is merely a question of detail.
It lasted for an infinitesimal time.
"But look here, Cavor," I said.
It was all tremendously huge.
How do you think we may begin?" I stood up.
I gripped his chains at once to unfasten them.
"They've got us," I said at last.
It is time she held her hand.
See! The stars seem larger.
He seemed to wriggle under my foot.
For a time I tugged silently at my bonds.
"They're all right," said Cavor.
Christopher was sleeping soundly.
The little oblong of twilight vanished.
"Yes?" I said, though I knew what was coming.
I was like a child in Wonderland all that night.
At that we cried aloud simultaneously.
At the time I believed the former was the case.
He had his watch out as I came up to him.
"Hullo yourself!" said I.
One forgot the hall and the crowd.
These hummocks looked like snow.
And my circumstances are abnormal - abnormal.
And it grew - the sphere.
At last I felt my moonward start was sufficient.
I heard Cavor exclaiming feebly.
I took no thought of consequences.
For a moment I hesitated.
I can hardly explain it yet.
"I became aware of a faint wheezy noise.
Then overtaking them came a huge white flame.
These bunks must have been built forever ago.
I had never thought of such a possibility before.
I was amazed at that lapse of time.
He came forward three steps and paused for a time.
But - there must be risks! There must be.
I heard Cavor's voice in alarm and entreaty.
I noted something in his hand.
People perhaps - " "People!" he exclaimed.
..." He peered upwards.
The sphere became very hot.
You never heard such buzzing.
.whether it wishes us well or ill.
The pink flame of its burning vanished.
"Who are you?", she asked.
But for a moment he did not start.
It was very fatiguing and hopeless.
After all, everything was coming right.
It was a small living room.
His message began to be received by Mr.
"Ass!" I said; "oh, ass, unutterable ass.
" Do I do that? " he asked.
"'Mooneys eat these?' said I to Phi-oo.
From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
Plump! I dropped beside him.
And there were the presents.
At the splash I flung the Cavorite shutters open.
On either side are the little eyes.
"After the pause came the salutation.
Even then I was satisfied with very little.
Suddenly Christopher tugged on her hand.
It was also unexpectedly difficult to express.
This air has evaporated - if it is air.
"Chuzz-flick," just one arrow came.
He regarded a puddle at his feet.
I noted the quality of the broken surfaces.
Tsi-puff took up position behind him.
They didn't look like elves.
"What have you got there? " I asked.
At which the Grand Lunar was even more amazed.
I searched the crater again.
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.
"Me look 'im," he said, "me think 'im very much.
In experimental work there always are.
.and the peace preserved.
I lost myself at last in bottomless speculations.
And I will do the same to the east.
It bent so suddenly that I almost slipped.
He shouted some faded inquiry.
It is not as though man had any use for the moon.
He spoke with a sudden lack of assurance.
"Not a bit of it," said the fat young man.
She didn't even try to be quiet.
And then our guide was pulling at my arm.
"Canterbury's as far as ever I been," she said.
"Don't just stand there!", said the Elf.
She liked the smell of the woods in the house.
We dropped into darkness.
But this time we saw nothing.
For an instant I could not believe my eyes.
Christopher and Cindi picked themselves up.
He it was who put that wish into your wife's head.
"It is truly beautiful," said the false Fatima.
This startled me very much.
The next day I returned to Cavor.
And what a world it must be.
and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.
Then with a click the window flew open.
At last I could rise and move about again.
He receded a step as though I had threatened him.
He was quite willing to supply information.
At any rate they all set up the same movement.
And besides, they get paid for polar expeditions.
At each jab came a shriek and twitter.
Cavor speaks of them as Phi-oo and Tsi-puff.
"It may be that." We tramped on for a space.
I read the children a story.
Those police officers read the children a story.
Those barbers made him some coffee.
They lend him the bicycle.
Those car mechanics told them a joke.
I struck a column of mean little advertisements.
We were bitten by a spirit of enterprise.
We stood clutching each other.
It was as still as death.
"I wonder now ..." he began.
"The thing's too mad," I said, "and I won't come.
A cold wind set all the crater shivering.
And so we advanced again.
Here, unhappily, comes a grave difficulty.
She fought to stay awake.
I perceived myself infinitely heavy and fatigued.
Or whether it might not still be going on.
She tried not to think of that.
The next day was Christmas Eve.
Those lights we saw..." He stopped.
"After all! What's it all for?" He smiled.
"There might be a chance to parley," said Cavor.
It lurched again, and the hissing grew louder.
But that was hoping far; I had first to get back.
That musician kept the milk cold.
Those farmers get the watch fixed.
They called him a taxi.
That dentist makes him cry.
That dentist calls him George.
Other things are doubtful, but that is certain.
Our way to the exterior was unexpectedly plain.
"I entered the last and greatest hall....
They did not stand for long.
Mrs. O'Day keeps the room clean.
I called him George.
I name the ship Titanic.
Those janitors named the dog Fido.
Those police officers paint the room green.
That bus driver elected her chairperson.
Those carpenters made him cry.
They get the watch fixed.
I made him cry.
.ask what you can do for your country.
Only - there would first of all be a volley.
Gestures, I fear, will be different.
My cooking would have shocked Mrs.
I sat meditating his words.
I was, I am certain, suddenly and vehemently ill.
I don't, I know perfectly well.
In doing so he rubbed the ring he still wore.
And so he attains his end.
And yet one never saw it as a fact.
We ought to have started the little things first.
"Have I been insensible long? " I asked.
And our voices are so much louder.
But never a sign of a Selenite was to be seen.
Only, confound him! he did not show it.
I gave an inarticulate cry.
Our muscles are scarcely educated yet.
"Well, we're committed," I said at last.
Phi-oo, he says, was about 5 ft.
Why did we ever leave the thing? ...
That seemed to give me double strength.
We stood gaping helplessly.
And I told them the truth.
I saw scarlet, as the saying is.
Hate all who draw like him better.
I didn't, of course, foresee this little upset.
And the breeze blew chill.
I hadn't the ghost of an idea then of his drift.
I halted, and stopped Cavor with my hand.
"Away from the sun and air," I said.
You can imagine how amazed Mr.
In your hands, my fellow citizens.
It became muffled, it dwindled, it died away.
Have you studied yet?
Those dentists sent him a package.
I buy her a gift.
They lent her a lot of money.
They asked him a question.
They lend him some money.
They sent him a package.
Hasn't Jennifer already shaved?
Haven't the politicians sung yet?
Those doctors run.
They shouted.
