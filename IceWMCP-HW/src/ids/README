The libhd uses two data bases: one for the names of the devices and one for
the driver info.

The format of the 'hd.drivers' file is described in README.drivers.

The 'hd.names' file follows loosely the format of the pciutils' id file with
some extensions (ids may be given as ranges, there can be a device class
attached to an entry (useful for ISA-PnP cards as they don't have device
class info).

As the parser in the libhd is rather picky, there is a perl script that
digests some formats and puts them into hd.names & hd.drivers in 'canonical'
form. In addition it generates the internal representation of the data,
ready to be included in libhd.

Note that libhd will look for the external data to add to its internal data
base. These external files must have the format of hd.names & hd.drivers.
They are looked for in the (then) current directory.

If you want to use *real* data: the perl script can read the pciutils id file,
SaX's identity file, PCI ids from
  http://home.hyperlink.net.au/~chart/download/vendors.txt
and, of course our own format (see names.sample & drivers.sample).

But check 'mk_ids.err' for conflicting info.


Have fun,
