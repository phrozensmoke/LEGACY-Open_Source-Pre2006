[PHTITLE] PhrozenClock
[PHSECTION] Overview
The IceWMCP PhrozenClock tool allows you to easily manage the time, date, and time zone on your system.   Generally, you have to be [PH-HI]'root'[/PH-HI] in order to use this tool, since Linux and Unix systems generally do not allow regular users to change the system's time.  PhrozenClock does not support .ics format zoneinfo files commonly found in Gnome Ximian Evolution-style applications, since most Glibc versions currently only support standard zoneinfo file formats.  PhrozenClock makes every possible effort to correctly distinguish between standard system zoneinfo data and .ics format zoneinfo data in order to protect your system.
[PHSECTION] Environment Variables
The following environment variables are supported to control where PhrozenClock looks for data: [PH-HI]TZ[/PH-HI], [PH-HI]TZDIR[/PH-HI].  (Examples: [PH-HI]TZDIR=/usr/share/zoneinfo/[/PH-HI], [PH-HI]TZ=/etc/localtime[/PH-HI])  You should set these environment variables if PhrozenClock shows you any messages indicating that it had trouble locating your 'zoneinfo' directory or finding your time zone's name. 
[PHSECTION] Setting The Date And Time
To set the [PH-HI]Date and Time[/PH-HI], click the [PH-HI]'Date & Time'[/PH-HI] tab.  Select the current [PH-HI]date[/PH-HI] from the [PH-HI]calendar[/PH-HI] on the left.  Select the correct [PH-HI]hour, minute, and seconds[/PH-HI] from the [PH-HI]clock[/PH-HI] on your right.  In addition, since PhrozenClock uses a 12-hour clock, you should select either [PH-HI]'AM'[/PH-HI] or [PH-HI]'PM'[/PH-HI].  24-hour clocks (military time)  are not supported by this program.
[PHSECTION] Setting The Time Zone
To set the [PH-HI]Time Zone[/PH-HI], click the [PH-HI]'Time Zone'[/PH-HI] tab.  Select your time zone from the list of available time zones at the bottom of the PhrozenClock window.  Click the [PH-HI]'Set Time Zone'[/PH-HI] button.
