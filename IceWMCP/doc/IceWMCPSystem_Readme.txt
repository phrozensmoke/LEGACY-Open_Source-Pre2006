GETTING THE 'IceWMCPSystem' PLUG-IN:

The 'IceWMCPSystem' plug-in is a new, somewhat experimental program for viewing extensive information about your computer's hardware (and other system information).  As of IceWM Control Panel version 2.3, the 'System' applet in the control panel is configured to launch the 'IceWMCPSystem.py' program, a plugin available on the download page (http://icesoundmanager.sourceforge.net/download.php) in packages starting with 'IceWMCP-Hardware-plugin'.  Information about the plug-in, and screenshots, can be found at:  http://icesoundmanager.sourceforge.net/modules/icewmcp-system.php .  Currently, pre-built, easy-to-install binary packages are available for i586-Intel systems in both tar-ball and RPM format (with 'i586' in their file names).  For all other systems, you will have to get the 'source' package.  NOTE: This is an UNSUPPORTED plug-in - NO technical support will be provided for this plug-in with regards to building, installing, or using the plug-in.  DO NOT send me emails with questions about the plug-in.  It works on my system!  If it works on yours...good, if not...oh well.  To repeat, this is an UNSUPPORTED PLUGIN  (though, not unmaintained).  This means if you can't get it to  build or install, do NOT whine to me about it: Fix it yourself or just forget about it.  That's why it is distributed as a PLUG-IN and not part of the main IceWMCP distribution package.  The IceWMCPSystem plug-in now replaces the old, next-to-useless 'guname' as the 'System' applet in the control panel.
