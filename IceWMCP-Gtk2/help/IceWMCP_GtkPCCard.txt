[PHTITLE] IceWMCP GtkPCCard
[PHSECTION] Overview
The IceWMCP GtkPCCard tool helps you manage PCMCIA cards.  PCMCIA cards, or PC Cards, are generally found on laptop computers, but exist on many other computers as well. To use GtkPCCard, you MUST have the [PH-HI] 'cardctl' [/PH-HI] program on your system's $PATH. The [PH-HI] 'cardctl' [/PH-HI] program is part of the [PH-HI]'pcmcia-cs'[/PH-HI] package, which can be found on [PH-HI]http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net[/PH-HI] and  [PH-HI]http://speakeasy.rpmfind.net[/PH-HI].  GtkPCCard will not be able to do anything useful without [PH-HI] 'cardctl' [/PH-HI].  In fact, GtkPCCard will not be able to display any of your PC Cards without [PH-HI] 'cardctl' [/PH-HI]. In addition, you generally have to be [PH-HI]'root'[/PH-HI] to do anything with GtkPCCard beyond simply displaying available PC Cards.
