This is a CONTRIBUTED, EXPERIMENTAL, and UNTESTED PyGtk-2 
port (for Gtk-2) of IceWMCP 2.3.  This means that this port may 
or may not run, the installation process may or not run (which 
means you will have to do a 'manual installation'), and this 
port requires PyGtk-2 for Gtk-2.  Since this is EXPERIMENTAL, 
do NOT send me 'bug reports' about this release.  

Eventually, when I have time and patience for it, an official 
PyGtk2 port will be available.  This package contains an 
UNOFFICIAL, EXPERIMENTAL port to PyGtk2.  I have not 
personally tested it myself.  

This package is contributed by:
	David Moore (djm ['at'] e3.net.nz)
	7-30-2003

He wrote the port using the following setup:
	RedHat9 packages -
	Py-GTK2 1.99.14, GTK2 2.2.1, Python 2.2.2.

At some point, I will move IceWMCP to Gtk-2, most likely using 
lots of stuff from his port but brining it up to speed with the 
rest of the application.  But for now, I don't even have PyGtk-2 
installed on my system, so I have not even tested this port.  It's 
being made available  1. to make sure the code is stored safely 
somewhere.   2.  for people desperate for a Gtk-2 port or people
looking to play around with such a port.   EXPECT BUGS, but 
don't report any bugs to me for this experimental package.

Also, because this package is based on IceWMCP 2.3, it is only 
compatible with IceWM up to IceWM version 1.2.8pre2.  So NO support 
for IceWM 1.2.8+ is included.  Also, this experimental package includes 
NO support for the IceWMCP-Hardware/System tool AT ALL.
