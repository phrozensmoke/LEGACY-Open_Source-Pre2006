VERSION 2.3 - 5/3/2003 - 5/15/2003


SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
	This release focuses on user interface improvements, and some usability improvements.

	The main IceWM Control Panel itself has undergone a major 'icon face-lift' and serious usability improvements.
	IceMe has a whole new, modern toolbar and a major start-up bug-fix.
	The IceWMCPMouse tool has been completely redesigned into a FULL-featured, all-in-one mouse configuration tool.
	The IceWMCPKeyboard tool has been completely redesigned into a FULL-featured, all-in-one keyboard configuration tool.
	Complete GUI redesign of the IceWMCPWallpaper desktop management tool.
	IcePref2 and IcePref2 Theme Designer now have a 'search' feature.
	Drastic 'start-up' speed improvement for IcePref2 when running in 'single module' mode.


Removed modules:
	IceWMCPCursors.py
	IceWMCPKeyEdit.py

Added modules:
	icepref_search.py: 'icepref_search' providing shared 'search' capabilities to both IcePref2 and IcePref2 Theme Designer - internal module
	icewmcp_dnd.py:  internal module for shared drag-n-drop code, to help reduce the size of all other modules needing drag-n-drop support
	IceWMCPSystem.py (and dependencies) - as separate PLUGIN in separate package


	- One new tool added:  IceWMCPSystem.py - A system information and hardware information tool built around a highly modified version of SuSe's 'libhd' hardware library.  Will be available as a PLUGIN for all i586-systems, 'source only' from CVS for all other systems.
	- The IceWMCPCursors module (and all associated applets, icons, and help files) has been REMOVED, since it has been 'merged'  (see below)
	- Tool merger: IceWMCPCursors has been merged with IceWMCPMouse and the 'Mouse' module of IcePref2 to form an all-in-one mouse configuration tool, so users no longer have to jump between 3 different applications to configure different mouse features.
	- Tool merger: IceWMCPKeyEdit has been merged with IceWMCPKeyboard and the 'Key Bindings' module of IcePref2 to form an all-in-one keyboard configuration tool, so users no longer have to jump between 3 different applications to configure different keyboard features.



IceWM Control Panel (IceWMCP)         (IceWMCP.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- New Feature:  IceWMCP now checks for the existence of the program an applet is attempting to launch - you are told if the program does not exist on your system: This gets rid of the problem of users potentially clicking applet icons for program that don't exist and wondering why it does 'nothing'
	- New Feature:  Added a new 'Column View' - very similar to the 'column view' in Windows Control Panel, bringing the total 'views' available up to 3: Icons, List, Columns
	- New Feature: A small 3-button toolbar for the available 'views' is available on the upper right hand corner of the IceWMCP screen, for one-click changing of icon views in the control panel
	- Bug Fix:  Fixed a bug where groups of applets starting with the same string (such as 'IceWM') often did not appear in complete alphabetical order in the control panel window - alphabetization of control panel applets is now strictly enforced
	- Changed several icons to better icons:  gfcc.png, gtop.png, usbview.png, soundprop.png, userinfo.png, kusers.png, sysinfo,png, gpassword.png, usermount.png, pyspool.png, icewmcp-keyboard.png, phrozenclock.png,godbc.png, icewmcp-ism.png, icewmcp-wallpaper.png, icewmcp-mouse.png, icesound.png, usbview.png, tkantivir.png, screensaver.png, iceme.png
	- Icons added for installation into icon path for: icewmcp-wallpaper, icewmcp-keyedit,  icewmcp-mouse, icewmcp-keyboard
	- As a consequence of the above, the default 'icon theme' looks slightly brighter and more modern, although the overall aqua-ish blue theme renames in place - overall feel is cleaner and more 3D-ish
	- Applet change:  'System Information' applet renamed to 'System'
	- Applet change:  new 'System' applet now launches new toon IceWMCPSystem instead of the old 'guname' program
	- Deliberately made the icons for 'IceWMCPKeyEdit' and 'IceWMCPKeyboard' more distinct (they were too similar and created confusion)
	- The 'IceWM Themes' applet now launches MUCH faster due to drastic start-up speed improvements in IcePref2 when running in 'single module' mode
	- Icon and applet for old 'IceWMCPCursors' have been removed. (All mouse configuration now housed under 'IceWMCPMouse')
	- Icon and applet for old 'IceWMCPKeyEdit' have been removed. (All keyboard configuration now housed under 'IceWMCPKeyboard')
	- A few additions/corrections to the gettext locale and Spanish language locale support
	- A couple of minor corrections to the 'Help' file
	- Small addition to 'help' file to accomodate new 'column view' feature


IceWMCP-DragNDrop       (icewmcp_dnd.py):
	- Debut of new shared internal drag-n-drop module for shared, uniform, basic drag-n-drop functionality across all IceWMCP applications; also adds drag-n-drop support for all 'color buttons'


IceWMCP-Common        (icewmcp_common.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- Removed 'app_map' Help file and bug reporter binding for old 'IceWMCPCursors' module
	- The small 'help' icon that appears on all common 'Help' windows has been changed to something that looks a little nicer (hopefully)
	- Bug Fix / Usability improvements:  Changed the way common Help windows are created: Help windows are no longer 'modal', so that use of the program can still continue while Help windows are open, and users no longer have to close a Help window to get back to using the program
	- Added new commonly used translated menu strings as constants:  HELP_MENU, ABOUT_MENU, FILE_MENU, EXIT_MENU, UPDATE_MENU
	- Locale support fix / Bug fix: changed the directory for the IceWMCP gettext locale directory from './locale' to getBaseDir()+"./locale" in the 'locale_dirs' list of locale directories.  This will help ensure loading of locale gettext catalogs no matter what path IceWMCP programs are launched from; also eliminates the need to change to the IceWMCP directory get the right gettext cataloge to load.



IceWMCP-Cursors        (IceWMCPCursors.py):
	- This module as been removed and has been merged with IceWMCPMouse.py - see below... (the old stand-alone 'IceWMCPCursors.py' module is now status 'unmaintained'


IceWMCP-Mouse        (IceWMCPMouse.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- Mouse tool has been drasticly overhauled and restructured, resulting in both usability and GUI improvements
	- Tool now contains 3 'notebook' tabs (and 3 tools in one):  Speed, Cursors, and Behavior
	- Tool merger: IceWMCPCursors has been merged with IceWMCPMouse and the 'Mouse' module of IcePref2 to form an all-in-one mouse configuration tool, so users no longer have to jump between 3 different applications to configure different mouse features.
	- New user interface is more organized, less cluttered, and has a more familiar 'Windoze' feel to it
	- The mouse tool is now a FULL featured mouse configuration tool, handling 3 tasks: managing mouse cursor speed, managing IceWM mouse cursors, and managing advanced mouse behavior under IceWM
	- The 'mouse speed' feature now uses a number 'slider' (similar to Windoze) instead of the old, uncomfortable 'drop-down' list
	- The 'panel' from IceWMCPCursors (and all its functionality) was added to the 2nd tab for easy configuration of IceWM mouse cursors
	- Fixed a bug from the old 'IceWMCPCursors' where clicking 'Apply Changes Now' did nothing  (missing gtk signal 'connect' was fixed.)
	- The 'panel' from IcePref2's 'mouse' module (and all its functionality) was added to the 2nd tab for configuring more advanced mouse features such as double-click speeds, desktop clicks, etc.
	- Appropriately, the Help files for IceWMCPMouse and the old IceWMCPCursors have been merged into a 'sectioned' help file.
	- The 'tab' first seen when the tool launches ('Speed') now features a small, but cute 3D image of a mouse...a la an actual 'control panel'  8-)
	- Minor, appropriate changes to the 'about' box for this tool
	- Minor updates, corrections, and additions to the locale and Spanish language locale support
	- Icon has been modestly to include the standard 'IceWM mountain' in the icon, to denote that it is an IceWM-specific application
	- Minor code adaptations to make program able to run inside new plugin 'IceWMCPSystem' 
 without causing unwanted 'quits'



IceWMCP-KeyEdit        (IceWMCPKeyEdit.py):
	- This module as been removed and has been merged with IceWMCPKeyboard.py - see below... (the old stand-alone 'IceWMCPKeyEdit.py' module is now status 'unmaintained'


IceWMCP-Keyboard        (IceWMCPKeyboard.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- Keyboard tool has been drasticly overhauled and redesigned, resulting in both usability and GUI improvements
	- Tool now contains 4 'notebook' tabs (and 4 tools in one):  Repetition, Sound, Shortcut Keys, and IceWM Keys
	- Tool merger: IceWMCPKeyEdit has been merged with IceWMCPKeyboard and the 'Key Bindings' module of IcePref2 to form an all-in-one keyboard configuration tool, so users no longer have to jump between 3 different applications to configure different keyboard features.
	- * New feature *:  New functionality - 'Sound'.  Keyboard tool now can manage the keyboard's beep and click sounds  (often called the keyboard 'bell'), allowing you to turn on/off the keyboard clicks and beeps, and adjust and test the  volume, pitch, and length of keyboard beeps
	- * New feature *: The keyboard repeat rate module (the 'Repetition') tab now allows you to turn keyboard repetition off/on, not just adjust the rate and delay.
	- New user interface is more organized, less cluttered, and has a more familiar 'Windoze' feel to it
	- The keyboard tool is now a FULL keyboard configuration tool, handling 4 major tasks: changing repeat rate/delay, changing keyboard bell sound, managing IceWM program shortcut keys, and managing IceWM-specific shortcut keys.
	- The keyboard 'rate' and 'delay' features now use number 'sliders' (similar to Windoze) instead of the old, uncomfortable 'drop-down' lists
	- The 'panel' from IceWMCPKeyEdit (and all its functionality) was added to the 2nd tab for easy configuration of IceWM shortcut keys
	- The 'panel' from IcePref2's 'Key Bindings' module (and all its functionality) was added to the 2nd tab for configuring more advanced mouse features such as double-click speeds, desktop clicks, etc.
	- Appropriately, the Help files for IceWMCPKeyboard and the old IceWMCPKeyEdit have been merged into a 'sectioned' help file.
	- Help files for both Spanish and English now include a section on the new 'Sound' feature.
	- An embedded version of 'IceWMCPKeyEdit' (now inside IceWMCPMouse) remains the shortcut editor for IceMe
	- The help file for 'IceWMCPKeyEdit' still remains for use inside IceMe's 'key editor' tool
	- The 'tab' first seen when the tool launches ('Repetition') now features a small, but cute 3D image of a keyboard...a la an actual 'control panel'  8-)
	- Minor, appropriate changes to the 'about' box for this tool
	- Minor updates, corrections, and additions to the locale and Spanish language locale support
	- The 'IceWMCPKeyEdit' module inside IceWMCPKeyboard has now been restructured to allow for easy embedding of the shortcut key editor panel (used in IceWMCPKeyboard) or running as a 'windowed' application (a feature used by IceMe)
	- GUI touch-up: Added a big of space around the column titles in the 'KeyEdit' module, so the words dont appear to right on the edge of the CList label
	- Minor code adaptations to make program able to run inside new plugin 'IceWMCPSystem' 
 without causing unwanted 'quits'



IceMe  (IceMe.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- Icon has been modestly changed to include the standard 'IceWM mountain' in the icon, to denote that it is an IceWM-specific application
	- Several corrections/updates to the Spanish language locale support, small corrections to the Spanish language help file
	- Removed associated but unused .xpm files: right.xpm, left.xpm (now moved to 'unmaintained' CVS repository)
	- Stability improvement / Bug fix : The __getTbButton method for loading pixmapped toolbar buttons  longer just 'crashes and quits' if a toolbar image can't be loaded, now it falls back to returning a regular GtkButton - so the program is still usable and helps guarantee that the program will not fail to start just because a pixmap can't be loaded.  Plain 'default' buttons on a toolbar when a image fails to load may not be pretty, but it's part of one of my goals to ensure that ALL programs always start and don't 'crash' because of little things like missing pixmaps.
	- The __getTbButton now uses the 'loadScaledImage' method from 'icewmcp_common' for loading toolbar images, so something besides .xpm can now be loaded
	- GUI touch-up: added a small amount of 'space' around the top tool bar, nothing drastic
	- Complete GUI overhaul of the IceMe top toolbar:  Almost all of the icons have been replaced with newer looking, more colorful icons  (the boring black and white icons from the old IceMe had to GO!)  - The icons are also more distintive (i.e. 'delete' looks like a DELETE)
	- GUI improvement:  Changed the 'clipboard' icon in the menu to something newer-looking and more colorful
	- GUI improvement:  The icon for the 'open' folder in "Command:" has been changed to something new-looking and more colorful
	- Top toolbar buttons now have the modern 'flat' look (though they become 'raised' when the mouse is moved over them.)
	- All IceMe icons have been converted from .xpm to .png images
	- Size of toolbar button icons changed from 22x22 to 23x23, not too big, but just enough to be more visible
	- Shortcut key editor now uses new 'embedded' version of 'IceWMCPKeyEdit', now inside IceWMCPKeyboard
	- Code Cleanup: Removed old, unused method 'on_add_shortcut_clicked' from the old IceMe
	- Code cleanup/Consolidation: Program now uses the shared drag-n-drop module 'icewmcp_dnd' for all drag-n-drop support dealing with menu item 'icons'  (This does not apply to d-n-d in the Menu 'tree')


IceWMCP-Wallpaper    (IceWMCPWallpaper.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- Complete user interface redesign of the 'preview window'
	- Major GUI improvement: Instead of the old 'scroll' window for previewing wallpapers, the desktop tool now features a realistic-looking, modern, plasma-ish 'monitor' - similar to the 'monitor' seen on the Windows control panel desktop applet and other desktop tools. 
	- As a consequence of the above, 4 'monitor' .png images had to be added and now there is no need to have to 'scroll' through the preview window
	- Emulation improvemnt:  Tool now does a much better job of emulating how wallpapers will look based on your screen's resolution- for example: selecting a 'centered' wallpaper that is too big for your screen will show it is partially 'chopped off' the way IceWM will...selecting a 'centered' wallpaper that is too small for your screen will show the 'extra space' that will be left on the screen....attemption to 'tile' an image that is the same size or larger than your screen won't tile, since IceWM will only 'tile' screen-size images once on the screen
	- Emulation improvement:  'Tiling' emulation has greatly improved - fiddled with a few of the algorithms in 'updateImage' method to make tiled images look more 'realistic' and 'true to life' on the 'monitor' preview screen
	- New feature:  Selecting a wallpaper now shows the dimensions of the image in the 'status bar'
	- New feature:  Attempting to 'tile' a image the same size or larger than your screen will show a small 'warning' in the 'status bar'  ("Too large to tile")
	- New feature:  An "Edit' button has been added to the far right of the 'Tile' checkbox for easy opening of the wallpaper for editing with 'gimp-remote'
	- New feature / GUI improvement:  Program now uses the shared drag-n-drop module 'icewmcp_dnd' for all drag-n-drop support; Support has been added for dragging and dropping colors on the 'color button', the 'color folder', and the color 'entry' from other Gtk applications with color dialogs (such as GColorSel, Gimp, etc.)
	- The overall default window size of the program is now not as wide (i.e. more compact), but not cramped...this is to help suit the new 'monitor' preview screen as well as lower resolution screens
	- Drag-and-drop is still supported:  Just drag wallpaper images onto the 'monitor'
	- 3 additions to the gettext locale and Spanish language locale support for 'Edit', "Edit with Gimp' and 'Too large to tile'
	- Code cleanup/Consolidation: Program now uses the shared drag-n-drop module 'icewmcp_dnd' for all drag-n-drop support
	- Minor additions/updates to the Help file to accomodate the new 'Edit' feature



IcePref2-Search       (icepref_search.py):
	- Debut of new module 'icepref_search' providing shared 'search' capabilities to both IcePref2 and IcePref2 Theme Designer for the literally hundreds of IceWM 'properties' - the search functionality is pretty basic at this point...showing the section + the property that matches a search word.  Currently, clicking or double-clicking on the list of 'search results' does nothing special.  However, the search feature now saves you from having to jump from tab to tab looking for certain IceWM features; you can now lookup the property, find the tab that holds the property quickly, and go to the necessary tab



IcePref2       (icepref.py):
	- Version is now 2.9
	- ** IMPORTANT CHANGE / PLEASE READ ** Coming in the next release of IceWM (1.2.8pre2) the preferences property 'ModMetaIsCtrlAlt' is being renamed to 'ModSuperIsCtrlAlt'.  (I checked the 'changelog' on the IceWM CVS server.) This name change in the IceWM 'preferences' file will have an effect on LOTS of users who rely on their 'Windows' key on their keyboards.   Currently IcePref2 will support BOTH the old 'ModMetaIsCtrlAlt' and the new 'ModSuperIsCtrlAlt' until the release of the final IceWM 1.2.8 ONLY.  This is to unsure that nobody's 'Windows' key stops 'working' due to an upgrade of IceWM Control Panel/IcePref2 while the developers of IceWM undergo preferences changes.   After that, all support for the now deprecated 'ModMetaIsCtrlAlt' will be REMOVED and users will need to upgrade to IceWM 1.2.8-final, whenever it is released.  Right now, ALL IcePref2 USERS MAY SEE A CONSOLE 'WARNING' WHEN LAUNCHING ICEWM saying that either the option 'ModMetaIsCtrlAlt' is 'deprecated' (if using IcePref 1.2.8pre2 or later) or the option 'ModSuperIsCtrlAlt' is 'unknown' (if using IcePref 1.2.8pre1 or before).  If you see this 'warning' please know that IT IS NOT A BUG, but is there by design while IceWM transitions from 1.2.7 to 1.2.8. This is an obvious draw-back, but is necessary to support both the old/new options until IceWM has released the final 1.2.8 version and people have a chance to upgrade to a 'stable' release with the new preferences property 'ModSuperIsCtrlAlt'.  Also, Win95keys are now enabled by default as of IceWM 1.2.8pre2, so the IcePref2 tradition of leaving Win95Keys on as 'default' is now officially 'in-sync' with the IceWM official defaults.  Watch for IceWM 1.2.8-final and UPGRADE to it when it is released if you do not want to see your 'Windows' key affected in future upgrades of IceWM Control Panel!
	- *New feature* : Basic, but useful search capabilities via the new 'icepref_search' module: you may now search through the literally hundreds of IceWM 'properties' rather than having to jump from tab to tab looking for certain IceWM properties in many sections
	- Added a new sub-class of 'Application' called 'PullTab', which allows for the embedding of IcePref2 'modules' (or tabs) into other applications - feature only accessible internally and is probably only of use to other programmers
	- *Property name change*: 'Multiple click time' in the 'Mouse' category has been renamed to the much clearer 'Mouse double-click speed'; This should eliminate any confusion as to what it means and whether it is for the keyboard or mouse.
	- Drastic 'start-up' speed improvement for IcePref2 when running in 'single module' mode. (by preventing IcePref2 from realizing/creating unnecessary widgets that will not be shown on the screen....useful for running IcePref2 with commands like 'icepref module=Themes')
	- new 'PullTab' class is used to embed the IcePref2 'Mouse' module into the  IceWMCPMouse tool
	- Bug Fix: fixed a bug where saving preferences could result in calls being made to non-existent widgets and 'blank' lines could be written into preferences files (i.e. some preferences could just be 'forgotten' during saving.)  This bug only existed when running in 'single module' mode
	- Bug Fix: Fixed a small but annoying bug reported by Jon Rutherford [jonrutherford ['at'] sbcglobal.net], where the default value for 'UseRootButtons' was set to '0' in IcePref2, causing users who had never used IcePref2 (or had never set any 'UseRootButtons' value in their 'preferences' file) to lose the ability to invoke menus by clicking on the desktop with mouse buttons.  The new default value for 'UseRootButtons' is now '255', which turns menu clicks on the desktop ON by 'default' unless the user chooses to disable them (this is the 'default' behavior for IceWM anyways) - Thanks to Jon Rutherford  [jonrutherford ['at'] sbcglobal.net] for the bug report.
	- Bug Fix: Fixed a long-standing, unwanted feature where the Apply/Restart button was 'disabled' when running on BSD systems
	- Bug Fix:  Clicking the 'Apply' button now also automatically saves the IceWM 'preferences' file  (This should have been done back in version 2.2 when the 'Restart' button transitioned to the 'Apply' button.)  - now clicking the 'Apply' button is a one-step method of saving and applying new preferences
	- Stability improvement: function for saving and reading preferences now catches ALL 'exceptions', not just 'IOError' exceptions
	- Fixed all of the IcePref2 shell scripts for launching various IcePref2 modules (such as icepref-Themes, icepref-ToolTips, etc.)...all scripts now call the RIGHT IcePref2 modules, so users may easily run 'portions' of IcePref2 as they see fit
	- *Major Spanish language improvements*:  major proofreading, grammatical and spelling corrections, and updates to the Spanish language support (gettext support); I finally found the time to proofread the whole gettext catalog; Still not yet close to 'perfect', but a SERIOUS improvement
	- Code cleanups:  Removed all old 'DEBUG' code left over from David Mortensen's original version of IcePref (no longer needed...was just code bloat)
	- Removed all but 2 archaic calls to 'print'  on the console (these 2 are needed), all others replaced with GUI dialogs, less 'junk' to be printed to stdout/stderr.
	- Locale additions:  added 14 missing locale translations for BitMask and MouseButton classes, Spanish translations implemented
	- Reconfigured many of the built-in IceWM 'defaults' to upgrade their values to the 'official' default values for IceWM version 1.2.7; All default fonts have been changed from Lucida fonts to Helvetica-family fonts.
	- Important changes in the built-in 'defaults: The default theme is now set to 'icedesert/default.theme';  MultiByte internationalizations support is now ON by default; XFreeType font support is now ON by default; Continuous Edge Switching of workspaces is now ON by default; Desktop Window Menu Button has been changed from '1' to '0'; Several Quick-Switch 'defaults' have been updated.   
	- Defaults that have been left with non-standard IceWM settings (for tweaks):  Support for Win95 keys [Win95Keys] is ON; TaskBarDoubleHeight is ON; ShowProgramsMenu is ON; 
	- Feature enhancement: Increased the number of configurable workspace names from 8 to 12
	- Feature enhancement: Actual IceWM 'pref' configuration keyword is now shown in the pop-up tooltips for each configurable feature, enclosed in [ ] - for example [MenuMouseTracking], for easier referencing to known configuration capabilities for people who have edited the 'preferences' file by hand before
	- GUI improvements: Several - Entry and Toggle widgets no longer 'stretch' out unnecessarily when they appear next to considerably larger widgets; 'WorkspaceNames' configuration area no longer takes up more space than needed - divided into 2 shorter and less-wide columns, so the workspace tab does not appear to have 'gaps' all over the place.  Eliminated unnecessary line breaks that often appeared in Entry, Toggle, and Label widgets; 'Rows' of widgets in the dual-columns are now forced to match up top-to-top; overall look is now much cleaner, neater, and less chaotic
	- New feature / GUI improvement:  Program now uses the shared drag-n-drop module 'icewmcp_dnd' for all drag-n-drop support; Support has been added for dragging and dropping colors on the 'color button' objects from other Gtk applications with color dialogs (such as GColorSel, Gimp, etc.)
	- GUI touch-up/usability improvement:  Tooltips added to the buttons next to the theme preview image box
	- Locale/gettext fix: Categories (on the menu) and tabs now always come up in alphabetical order, even when not running under the English (EN) locale.  (Several Spanish and Russian users had reported 'unorganized' ordering of the categories and tabs.)




IcePref2-TD            (icepref_td.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- *New feature* : Basic, but useful search capabilities via the new 'icepref_search' module: you may now search through the literally hundreds of IceWM 'properties' rather than having to jump from tab to tab looking for certain IceWM properties in many sections
	- Code cleanups:  Removed all old 'DEBUG' code left over from David Mortensen's original version of IcePref (no longer needed...was just code bloat)
	- Removed all archaic calls to 'print'  on the console, replaced with GUI dialogs, less 'junk' to be printed to stdout/stderr.
	- fixed a bug where saving themes could result in calls being made to non-existent widgets and 'blank' lines could be written into theme files (i.e. some theme properties just be 'forgotten' during saving.)
	- Reconfigured many of the built-in IceWM theme 'defaults' to upgrade their values to the 'official' default values for IceWM version 1.2.7; All default fonts have been changed from Lucida fonts to Helvetica-family fonts.
	- New feature / GUI improvement:  Program now uses the shared drag-n-drop module 'icewmcp_dnd' for all drag-n-drop support; Support has been added for dragging and dropping colors on the 'color button' objects from other Gtk applications with color dialogs (such as GColorSel, Gimp, etc.)
	- *Major Spanish language improvements*:  major proofreading, grammatical and spelling corrections, and updates to the Spanish language support (gettext support); I finally found the time to proofread the whole gettext catalog; Still not yet close to 'perfect', but a SERIOUS improvement
	- Locale/gettext fix: Categories (on the menu) and tabs now always come up in alphabetical order, even when not running under the English (EN) locale.  (Several Spanish and Russian users had reported 'unorganized' ordering of the categories and tabs.)
	- Portability improvement:  The default 'Directory' for saving a theme in the 'New Theme...' window now uses getIceWMConfigPath()+"themes/", instead of the hard-coded '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/themes/"
	- GUI touch-up: Added a little space around the 'OK' and 'CANCEL' buttons in the 'New Theme...' window, so the words don't appear to be right on the edge when using Gtk themes with rounded buttons



IceWMCP-WinOptions          (IceWMCPWinOptions.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- GUI touch-up: Added a big of space around the column titles in the 'KeyEdit' module, so the words dont appear to right on the edge of the CList label

IceWMCP_Dialogs  (IceWMCP_Dialogs.py):
	- Dialog icons changed for all 'common dialogs', to clearer, more distinct, more colorful icons (most with nice 3D effects)


IceSoundManager        (icesound.py):

	- *Major Spanish language improvements*:  major proofreading, grammatical and spelling corrections, and updates to the Spanish language support (gettext support); I finally found the time to proofread the whole gettext catalog; Still not yet close to 'perfect', but a SERIOUS improvement
	- GUI touch-up: The 'Audio Interface' window now has extra space around the widgets, so the 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons don't appear to be right on the bottom edge; main widget box is now a GtkVBox instead of a GtkFrame
	- GUI touch-up: The 'Preferences' window now has extra space around the widgets, so the 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons don't appear to be right on the bottom edge
	- Minor updates to the Spanish language main 'Help' file
	- Loads of updates and corrections to other 'internal' Spanish language help windows throughout the program  (part of the gettext corrections, really)


PhrozenClock  (phrozenclock.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- The icon has been changed to a much nicer looking aqua/crystal type icon
	- A separate, stand-alone version of PhrozenClock will NOT be released this time around (not enough changes to warrant a new release.)


IceWMCP_GtkPCCard     (IceWMCP_GtkPCCard.py):
	- Version is now 1.2
	- Minor code adaptations to make program able to run inside new plugin 'IceWMCPSystem' 
 without causing unwanted 'quits'
	- One minor Spanish locale update

IceWMCPRun  (IceWMCPRun.py):
	- Version is now 2.3
	- GUI touch-up: Added a little space around the 'Browse...' button, so the words don't appear to be right on the edge when using Gtk themes with rounded buttons

	


TODO     (My personal reminders):  
	- ** IMPORTANT CHANGE / PLEASE READ '** Coming in the next release of IceWM (1.2.8pre2)  the preferences property 'ModMetaIsCtrlAlt' is being renamed to 'ModSuperIsCtrlAlt' - relating to the 'Windows' key.  When the 'final' version of IceWm 1.2.8 is released, REMOVE the deprecated/old option 'ModMetaIsCtrlAlt' to eliminate 'console warning' about the deprecated option.  Also, continue to monitor changes in the IceWM preferences until the final release of 1.2.8 (changelog on CVS server:  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/icewm/icewm-1.2/CHANGES?rev=1.21&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup)
	- new translation strings sent to Vasya (5/11/2003), awaiting translations from Vasya for Russian updates: update: 5/20 - still haven't heard back from him
	- Find out the status of the IceSoundManager help file Vasya is translating into Russian on his web site...I can convert that to IceWMCP 'help' format myself.  - UPDATE: Vasya is almost done with the HTML page, should be ready soon (5/7/2003)  update: 5/20 - still haven't heard back from him
	- Make the following tools able to run as 'root' to edit 'system' IceWM files: IceMe, IcePref2, IceWMCPWinOptions, IceWMCPKeyboard, IceWMCPMouse  (Note: The 'KeyEdit' component already allows this as you can load ANY file from the file system, but this is only PART of the 'Keyboard' tool.  Technically, the IceWMCPWinOptions module already allows complete 'root' functionality since you can load ANY file from the file system - any need for change on WinOptions???  - Maybe a global RUN_AS_ROOT command is needed for all apps via 'icewmcp_common'?  IceMe has a commandline option for editing 'system' menu - port to GUI.  IceWMCPCursors and IcePref2 lack ANY kind of 'root' functionality - must add)
	- New control panel applet under consideration:  Maybe a small EnergyStar/DPMS applet? (using xset)
	- New control panel applet under consideration:  Some type of 'font manager' or third-party font tool???  ...maybe hard to implement 'uniform' font installation under X, but at least an applet for viewing installed fonts??
	- Maybe Vasya is willing to translate new help files for /help/ru/ for Russian locale ??? 
	- Speed up IceMe start-up (play with speed of icon loading)
	- Is there a better way to handle the drag-n-drop support for the 'color buttons' in IcePref2 and Theme Designer?  Currently unable to handle the 'native unicode' junk returned the 'application/x-color' GtkSelectionData.data object - so letting it get handled by a hidden GtkColorSelectionDialog (global COLOR_HOLDER):
			# I tried this:
			#    import codecs
			#    uni=codecs.utf_16_decode(drago[4].data)
			# creates a tuple with a useless 'unicode' string that Python can do nothing with
			# In fact, it can't even be turned into a string with str() - You can print the 
			# tuple to stdout, but not the 'unicode' string at element '0' in the tuple

Work around: self.GLOBAL_ICEWM_DIR gets a default non-null value from the 'getIceWMConfigPath' method in 'icewmcp_common.py' if the global IceWM directory cannot be detected - this is also a good code cleanup.
	- Major bug fix: Fixed a bug where closing the icon selection dialog in IceMe with the window's 'X' button, then re-opening the icon selection dialog resulted in a empty black window, "GtkCritical' messages on the console, and required a 'kill' of IceMe in most cases, problem should now be eliminated

	- Bug fix: Fixed a bug where running IcePref2 left the status bar as 'Running Icepref2...' indefinitely
	- Bug fix: Fixed a bug where showing the Preview window left the status bar as 'Displaying preview window...' indefinitely
	- Usability improvement: The icon selection dialog now reports any errors loading certain icons in a Dialog box, not on the console like the old IceMe
	- GUI improvement: The menu 'Preview' window now has a little space around the edge of the menu, so icons don't appear to be right on the window's edge

	- Several additions to the locale support, additional translations added to the Spanish language locale support
	- IceMe appears to start slightly faster, but nothing drastic

	- added 'icon discovery', the path of icons used in the menu file which are not on IceWM 'IconPath' will be added to the Icon Selection Dialog for viewing  (makes better sense)
	- added the new maintainer of IceMe's name to the 'about' credits
