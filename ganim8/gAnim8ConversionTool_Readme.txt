http://ganim8.sourceforge.net.  The gAnim8 Conversion Tool is part of gAnim8, a suite for building, viewing, and editing animated GIFS and small videos.  The gAnim8 Conversion Tool allows easy conversion from one image format to another via the "convert" utility from ImageMagick.  Technically, it"s just a quick frontend for ImageMagick's 'convert' utility, but may be useful nonetheless.  NOTE:  The gAnim8 Conversion Tool  is still EXPERIMENTAL, but seems to be working rather well.   

Some image formats listed may not be supported on your system and may fail to convert or even crash this program. If you have trouble converting to very obscure formats, please check the ImageMagick documentation for additional information on extra filters and third-party programs which may be required for the format. Also, make sure your have a recent version of ImageMagick.

Running the program:  You should be able to launch the program by simply executing 'ganim8ct', or by executing 'python /usr/share/gAnim8/gAnim8ConversionTool.py'.

 
This program requires Python 2.2 or better, Python Numeric, PyGTK 0.6.9 or better,  Gtk+ 1.2.8-4 or better, Imlib 1.9.8.1-6 or better, ImageMagick 5.2.3 or better (5.4.6 or better recommended).  Recommended but not required: gifsicle 1.3.0 or better for GIF compression.
