msgid "VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR NEW USERS. Please note that gAnim8 works with TEMPORARY copies of all files ONLY.  This means you should have no fear of playing around with your GIFs and animations, while not having to worry about destroying the original copies.  This ALSO means that these temporary copies of your GIFs are automatically deleted from your system by gAnim8 when they are no longer needed. So, if you edit your GIFs (particularly the frames in your animations) be sure to click the 'Save...' button next to the frame and save it as a permanent file if you wish to keep those changes, as they will be automatically deleted by gAnim8 when you exit this program or start a new animation.  TO REPEAT: If you open an animation, you will be working with a COPY of that animation, not the original animated Gif.  If you add a GIF frame to an animation, you will be working with a COPY of your GIF, not the original.  By the way, temporary files are stored in either your home directory under ~/.ganim8/tmp/ or under /tmp/ (for those of you who care). You will not see this message again unless you do a fresh installation under your username, or your Options file becomes disappears or becomes damaged  or unreadable."

You can easily SCALE the size of your image (and preserve the aspect ratio) by setting only the width and leaving the height set to '0', or by setting the height and leaving the width set to '0'.  In this case, Gifsicle will automatically scale the image for you, keeping the aspect ratio intact.  For example, if you want to scale the image to a width of 300 pixels. Simply type '300' for width and leave the 'height' set to '0'.  Gifsicle will pick the best height for a width of 300.  It's that easy.  8-)"

msgid "http://ganim8.sourceforge.net.\n  \ngAnim8 is a program for creating animated GIFs and small videos.   gAnim8 is  built on top of the wonderful Gifsicle program.  gAnim8 is a frontend for Gifsicle and more.  However, gAnim8 and its author are in NO way affiliated with or endorsed by Gifsicle or the authors of Gifsicle.  gAnim8 is not an  \"official\" extension to Gifsicle and is NOT a modification of the Gifsicle code in anyway.  gAnim8 relies on the excellent functionality of Gifsicle, but does not incorporate any of its code.  gAnim8 is not intended to be the next Gimp. It is intended to be a simple, effective GUI for creating and retouching animated GIFs and small videos. \n \nWritten with Python/PyGTK/PyGnome.     \n \nLicense: W3C (open source). View  \"License\" on the Help menu for more details.  This program and its source may be freely modified and redistributed for non-commercial,  non-profit use only."
