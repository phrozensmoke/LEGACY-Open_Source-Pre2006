If you are a translator who wishes to make a language translation for gAnim8 or one of gAnim8's tools, feel free to use the .po files with the word "-empty" in the file names.  These special .po files are gettext-compatible files, with almost all of the translatable strings extracted and ready to translate. Spanish language locale support has already been implemented.  If you create a translation file, please send a copy to the author (PhrozenSmoke@yahoo.com) and I will be sure to incorporate it into the next release and place it on CVS.
