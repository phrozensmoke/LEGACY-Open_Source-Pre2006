##  PYINSTALLSHIELD CONFIGURATION FILE - USE ONE FILE FOR BOTH INSTALL AND UNINSTALL

# installation type:  either 1 for Linux/Posix/Unix, or 2 for Windows - This isnt necessary but CAN be uncomment if 
#  PyInstallShield should be first to install as a certain OS
#install_type=1

# The directory to install your program in - the user can still select another from within PyInstallShield
# Include ths trailing slash.  A copy of PyUnInstallShield will automatically be placed in install_dir, for later 
# uninstallation, and an 'uninstall' script or Start Menu link will automatically be created. The direction of the 
#  slashes no longer matters - PyInstallShield will auto-detect the right 'slash' for the operating system

install_dir=/usr/share/PyBabelPhish/
#install_dir=C:/Program Files/PyBabelPhish/

bin_dir=/usr/X11R6/bin/
icon_dir=/usr/share/icons/

# The name of your program - will be showed to the users in PyInstallShield - do NOT include the version number in the name
install_app_name=PyBabelPhish

# The version number of your application - put the version HERE, not in the name above
install_app_version=2.1

# The XPM to show at the top of the setup program - best to put it in the same directory as PyInstallShield.py
# However, it can be in a subdirectory, as shown below. This directory is relative to the location of 
#  PyInstallShield.py
install_pixmap=pixmaps/babtitle.gif

#  Would you like to show a license to the user when PyInstallShield starts? PyInstallShield will exit if the user doesn't 
#  'agree' to the license, set show_license to 0  if you don't want to show any license at all.  The license is NOT shown 
#  during UN-installation, only during installation.
show_license=1

# Enter the file name of the license, this should be a plain text file
# If you you have show_license set to '1' but still see no license, make sure you have the path and filename of the 
# license file name correct
license=user-doc/PyBabelPhish-LICENSE

# a license in the 'doc' subdirectory of your distribution (on linux)...
#license=doc/PyBabelPhish-LICENSE
# a license in the 'doc' subdirectory of your distribution (on windows)...
#license=doc/PyBabelPhish-LICENSE


# A list of as many Python scripts (.py,.pyc,.pyo) or .exe files to make executable (an put on the Start Menu in windows)
#  All 'exe' values MUST be declared in the 'file' section at the bottom of this configuration file.  You only need to 
#  create this section if you are going to be making system 'links'  (Linux or Windows) - NOTE: For this to work, 
#  you must also have 'install_links' set to 1  down below.
#exe=pybabelfish.py
#exe=my_second_program.py
#exe=my_third_program.exe

# an application in a subdirectory called 'bin' - for Linux/Unix:
#exe=bin/my_program.exe
# an application in a subdirectory called 'bin' - for Windows:
#exe=bin/my_program.exe

#  NOTE: You can specify a specific name for the link to be created from the EXE...on Windows, this is the name
#  that appears in the Start Menu....on Linux/Unix, this is the name of the startup shell script to be placed in 
#  either /usr/X11R6/bin or /usr/bin....to do this: use   [script],[link name]  - see below

exe=pybabelfish.py,pybabelphish


# For Windows, this might be better since the 'link' will be on the Start Menu and should be human-readable...
#exe=pybabelfish.py,PyBabelPhish v.0.1a

#Do you want to remove all the installation files after a successful installation?   0=No,1=Yes
install_clean=0

#  Do you want to install useful links?  
#  On Linux/Unix, this will create an easy to use shell script from the name of each 'exe' value above:
#  For example, /usr/X11R6/bin/pybabelfish   will be created to launch the pybabelfish.py script
#  The user could then just type 'pybabelfish' to launch the program, this also eases adding the application to the menu
#  For the user.   All script names will converted to lower case.  You can add icons to the system icon folder (see below)
#
#  On Windows, creating links on the 'Start Menu' is not yet supported
install_links=1

#  This is for Linux/Unix systems ONLY:  Do you want to install icons in the system icon folder?
#  Any 'icon' values specified below will be copied to the /usr/share/icons/  
#  and /usr/share/pixmaps/ folders, the standard icon folders on most Unix/Linux systems.
# NOTE: The icons will only be copied to these folders if the folders already exist on the system
#    The user can then easily add your application to their Window Managers menu.
#  If you are creating an installation for Windows, or you don't want to install icons, comment out all 'icon' values below.
#  The default behavior is to install no icons.  You should give your icon name a name that is unlikely to already exist 
#  in the system icon folders.  It is not necessary to declare 'icon' files in the 'file' section below, unless you just want 
#  to keep an extra copy of the icon in the installation directory

icon=pybabel_icon.png


# Application files:  Here you specify ALL other supporting files for you application. All files will be either in the 'install_dir'
#  or a sub-directory of 'install_dir'.  Installing to directories outside of 'install_dir' is not supported at this time. Do NOT 
#  include folders or directories, only actual files.  Bascially, this just copies your application 'tree' to the user's preferred 
#  installation directory.   For example, if you have  a file called  'pixmaps/mytitle.xpm' in a subdirectory called 'pixmaps', 
#  mytitle.xpm will be copied to  install_dir/pixmaps/mytitle.xpm,  will be in install_dir. Remeber to list all of you, 'exe'
#  values here.  Only list your 'icon' values here if you want to store an additional copy of the icon in install_dir
