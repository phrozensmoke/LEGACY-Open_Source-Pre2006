gtkyahoo

A lot of information and a few display functions were also gleaned from the
GTKyahoo yahoo messenger/pager program by Nathan Neulinger <nneul@umr.edu>.
GTKyahoo is available at: http://www.umr.edu/~nneul/
GTKyahoo code is Copyright by Nathan Neulinger and released under the GPL.

The status icons are from GTKyahoo as is yahoolib.h.  I plan on enhancing
yahoolib to support yahoo chat and returning the changes back to the yahoolib
author in the future.

The src/yahoolib.h and src/yahoolib.c files are also from the GTKyahoo
package, the license and copyright for those files is contained within them.

parsecfg

The parsecfg source for the config file parser is Copyright Yuuki Ninomiya
and is available under the GPL.  Here is his contact information:

md5 code

The md5 code for YMSG authentication comes by way of curphoo by way of
gaim.  Curphoo is a text-mode python Yahoo! chat client.  Gaim is a
yahoo/aol/etc. messenger client.  All the code is covered by the GPL
and remains so and copyright by the original authors.  The included
files are: yahoo_md5.c, yahoo_md5.h, yahoo_crypt.c, md5.c, and md5.h.

yahmini

Gyach is based upon a CLI program called yahmini which was written by
David J. Binette (MasterDeep) and ported to *nix by ronin_aurora_eagle.
The yahmini code has been extensively modified and will hopefully be broken
out into a library of routines at some point in time.  Yahmini
is Copyright by David J. Binette.  Yahmini is available at:

	http://www.stas.net/deep/files/yahmini/

	"Yahmini, with PMs, Invite, Join, Goto, Think, Dice, Colors (with
		ansi.sys) and more, all in 11776 bytes
		http://www.stas.net/deep/files/yahmini/"...  David J. Binnette

David has granted permission for the use of yahmini source code within this
program but he still retains copyright on portions he wrote.

NOTE: As of Gyach v0.8.0, virtually all yahmini code has been replaced since
Gyach has been converted to work with Yahoo's new YMSG protocol instead of
the old YCHT protocol.

NOTE2: All yahmini code has now been eliminated from Gyach.
