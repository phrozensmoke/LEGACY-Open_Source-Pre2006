For new users, <b>it is NOT necessary to memorize the list of

LOGIN PROBLEMS / CONNECTING VIA WEB LOGIN:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
If you have problems connecting due to several <b>'Incorrect
Password'</b> messages and are SURE you are entering your
password correctly, it is possible Yahoo has changed the login
routine.  If you are getting messages saying that your 
<b>'account is locked'</b>, first try logging into your Yahoo! account 
at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a>. 
If something is wrong with your Yahoo account, their website 
will tell you and you will need to correct the problem over at their 
website by following whatever instructions they provide you. 
Once you are able to successfully login into your Yahoo! account 
over at Yahoo's web site, try to login again using Gyach-E. If the problem continues, and you continue to receive 'Incorrect 'Password' error messages, it is likely 
that Yahoo has changed its login system and Gyach-E will need to 
be updated to accomodate the change. Check the Gyach-E website 
to see if there is a new release available that fixes the login problem 
you are experiencing: <a href="http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/">http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/</a>.  If there is a newer version of Gyach-E available, newer than the version you are currently using, download and install the <b>latest version</b> from the website above. If a new release is not currently available, it is probably on its way.  In the meantime, you may try using one of
the <b>'web login'</b> servers to connect to Yahoo.  The 'web login'
servers appear at the end of the list of servers in the <b>Login
window</b> and start with the name <b>'WEB LOGIN'</b>.  There are a few things
you should know about using 'web login' servers: 
This is an experimental, BACKUP connection method,
supporting only PMs and conferences. This method
does not allow you to login as invisible, change your away status, or add/remove
buddies on your buddy list. Several other major
features may also be unavailable. As of version 1.0.5, 
you can access chat rooms when connected via 'web login' 
 using the YCHT (Java) protocol, which does 
not support chat 'nicknames' or quick profiles.  If you just want to chat and have 
no need for conferences and instant messaging, you can also 
connect using one of the <b>'YCHT'</b> servers in the list. If you 
connect using the YCHT (Java) protocol only, you will not 
have access to webcams, chat 'nicknames' or quick profiles. Generally speaking,  
advanced Yahoo features will be missing when connected using the 
'web login' or 'ycht' methods: Audibles, 
imvironments, avatars, buddy images, etc. In addition, 
the 'web login' and 'ycht' servers are notoriously unreliabled: Sometimes 
they are up and running, sometimes they are not, and don't 
be surprised if you are disconnected frequently. You should only 
use 'web login' servers if all other servers fail. These can 
be used as backups until the main connection methods 
are fixed by the program maintainer.

SOMEONE KEEPS BOOTING ME!
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
If you keep getting 'booted' (someone is sending you stuff that 
is disconnecting you from Yahoo), there are a few things you 
can try to avoid this annoyance.  First, click <b>'Setup'</b> on the Gyach-E 
menu, then click the <b>'Protection'</b> tab. In the <b>'Privacy and Security'</b>  
section make sure that BOTH <b>'basic boot prevention'</b> and <b>'advanced 
boot prevention'</b> are checked. Also, make sure the option named 
<b>'Only friends may add me to their buddy list'</b> is checked. In the section below, <b>'Allow PMs, invitations, and files from:'</b>, make sure that ONLY <b>'Friends'</b> is checked. 
If you continue to get booted, you should try staying invisible for a little 
while.  Finally, if you ONLY want to use the chat rooms and have no need 
for conferences and advanced features at the moment, try connecting 
using one of the <b>'YCHT'</b> servers in the <b>Login</b> window. These servers use 
the YCHT (Java) chat protocol, and, when connected to them, it is nearly 
impossible to be booted. If you connect using the <b>YCHT (Java)</b> protocol 
only, you will not have access to webcams, chat 'nicknames' or quick profiles; however, 
voice chat is available in the chat rooms if the room supports it. Generally speaking,  
advanced Yahoo features will be missing when connected using the 
  'ycht' method: Audibles, imvironments, avatars, buddy images, etc. You should also 
read the section in this document <b>'HELP ON PRIVACY AND STEALTH SETTINGS'</b> for 
more information about staying invisible from people who might be 'booting' you.

</font><br>&nbsp; <br>


<font size="4" color="#0088AA"><b>
SPAM PROTECTION:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
Often on Yahoo! you will see screen names enter a chat
and do nothing other than post advertisements for porn
web sites, get-rich-quick schemes, etc.  Many times these
'spam-bots' will even send you PMs with advertisements. To
limit the spam you see in chats and PMs, click 'Configuration'
on the menu, then click the 'Protection' tab.  Under 'Spam 
Protection' be sure that 'Enable Spam Protection' is checked.
Note: Enabling spam protection also automatically mutes
Yahoo! 'guest' users and @sbcglobal.net users, since the vast
majority of such 'guest' users are in fact 'spam-bots'.  Since
'spam-bots' change names and make new names frequently,
it is a bad idea to try to 'ignore' every spam-bot you see.
Instead, enabling spam protection 'mutes' spammers
for the duration of the current Gyach Enhanced session,
preventing your Ignore list from becoming too large. Currently,
the spam protection feature is very effective, muting well over
95% of chat and PM spammers. Spam protection has also 
been extended to cover the text sent with 'Audibles', as it is 
only a matter of time before spammers start sending 'Audible' 
spam. <b>If you notice that Gyach-E keeps auto-muting a 
user that you do not wish to have auto-muted, you may make 
this user 'immune' to auto-muting by LEFT-clicking on the user's 
name in the list of chat room users, then clicking 'Do Not Auto-Mute' 
on the popup menu that appears. You may also disable Spam 
protection by  doing the following: Click 'Configuration' on the menu, 
then click the 'Protection' tab.  Under 'Spam Protection' be sure that 
'Enable Spam Protection'  is NOT checked. (Disabling Spam 
protection is NOT recommended.)</b>

</font><br>&nbsp; <br>

<font size="4" color="#0088AA"><b>
HELP ON PRIVACY AND STEALTH SETTINGS:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
If you believe someone has placed you on their buddy list
without your permission (perhaps a stalker?), or you no longer 
wish to be on a person's buddy list,  you can REMOVE
yourself from his/her buddy list by clicking <b>'Tools'</b>, then 
<b>'Yahoo! Privacy Settings...'</b> on the menu.  In the box titled 
<b>'Remove my name from this user's buddy list:'</b>, type the name of the user whose buddy 
list you wish to be removed from. Then, click the <b>'OK'</b> button 
next to the box. In addition, you should type the person's name in the 
box titled <b>'I am permanently offline to this user:'</b>, then 
click the <b>'OK'</b> button next to that box.  To prevent 
strangers from being able to see when you are online, you should 
also make sure the following boxes in the <b>'Yahoo! Privacy Settings...'</b>
window are <b>NOT</b> checked: <b>'Allow users to see when I am in Games.'</b> and <b>'Allow Yahoo! websites to show when I'm online.'</b>. Finally, click the 
<b>'OK'</b> button at the very bottom of the <b>'Yahoo! Privacy Settings...'</b> window. 
Note: If you remove a friend from your buddy
list, you will automatically be given an option to remove yourself
from their buddy list as well.

<br>
<br>
To make yourself selectively visible/invisible 
to a friend on your buddy list, select the friend's name on your buddy list, 
click the <b>right mouse button</b> once, then select <b>'Stealth Settings...'</b> 
from the popup-menu. With this feature, you may appear 'offline' to all friends 
except the ones you choose to appear visible to, or appear temporarily 
or permanently 'offline' to certain friends who have become a nuisance.
<br><br>
For more privacy and security
options, click 'Setup' on the menu, then click the 'Protection' tab.
Be sure to pay close attention to the 'Privacy and Security' section.

</font><br>&nbsp; <br>

<font size="4" color="#0088AA"><b>
TEMPORARY BUDDY LIST:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
You can temporarily allow a specific person all the privileges of
people on your friends list WITHOUT having to add them to your
real buddy list.  They will not appear on your buddy list, and
their buddy privileges end after you close GYach Enhanced
or remove their 'temporary' friend status. Temporary friends are
given almost all the privileges of a person on your real buddy list
provided you don't have them on 'ignore'.  A person who is on your
real buddy list may NOT be added as a 'temporary' friend. This feature
is useful if you wish to accept a PM, file, chat invitation, etc. from a
particular user without having to add them to your real buddy list and
without having to open your PMs to everybody in the room or everybody
on Yahoo. You may manage your list of temporary friends by clicking
'Tools' -> 'Temporary Friends...' on the Gyach Enhanced menu.

</font><br>&nbsp; <br>

<font size="4" color="#0088AA"><b>
BUDDY IMAGES:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
As of version 1.0.4, Gyach Enhanced supports Buddy Images.  Buddy Images are the pictures displayed on the right side of the PM window.  The official Yahoo! program added support for Buddy Images with the release of Messenger 6.  (You must have PM windows enabled to use Buddy Images.)  You should see 2 squares on the right side of your PM window denoting images, possibly 'blank' images.  To change, show, hide, or configure your Buddy image, click the bottom image box and follow the instructions in the window that appears.  Please note that all Buddy Images are scaled to a size of 96x96 pixels and converted to 96-128 color PNG images. (Yahoo requires these dimensions.)  You MUST have the ImageMagick executable named 'convert' on your path to use this feature: Most modern linux systems already have it.

</font><br>&nbsp; <br>

<font size="4" color="#0088AA"><b>
WEBCAM:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
Gyach Enhanced supports both viewing webcams and sending webcam images to other users.  If it appears your copy of Gyach Enhanced did not come with webcam capabilities, you may download and install the <a href="http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/">Gyach-E Webcam Utilities</a>.  Be sure to read the instructions and system requirements on the website carefully. Currently, only cameras compatible with the Video4Linux (V4L) version 1 standard are supported.  The webcam broadcasting utility has been extensively tested with an OV511+ USB camera and is  likely to perform well with those types of cameras (I can't speak for other camera models). Generally speaking, you can access all of the necessary webcam features from the 'Tools' menu in the main window as well as the menu in any PM window.

</font><br>&nbsp; <br>

<font size="4" color="#0088AA"><b>
VOICE CHAT:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
GYach Enhanced is designed to use the pY! Voice Chat program
for voice chat features.  You may obtain a copy of pY! Voice
Chat at <a href="http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/">http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/</a> if you don't
already have a copy of the software.  To use pY! Voice Chat in a
chat room or conference room, enter the room of your choice.
Then, click 'Rooms' -> 'Enable Voice Chat' on the menu. Next, click
'Rooms' -> 'Start pY! Voice Chat' on the GYach Enhanced menu.
To use pY! Voice Chat in a PM (still experimental), click the Voice
Chat button on the PM (Private Message) window.  Next, click 
'Rooms' -> 'Start pY! Voice Chat' on the GYach Enhanced menu.
Once pY! Voice Chat has started, click the 'On' button to start
the voice chat.  NOTE: Anytime you exit pY! Voice Chat, you will
need to re-enable voice chat by clicking 'Rooms' -> 'Enable Voice Chat'
on the GYach Enhanced menu (for chat rooms and conference rooms),
or by clicking the Voice Chat button on the PM box (for private messages.)

</font><br>&nbsp; <br>

<font size="4" color="#0088AA"><b>
SENDING INSTANT MESSAGES TO MULTIPLE USERS:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
Gyach Enhanced is the first (or, one of the first) Linux applications to allow sending instant messages to multiple Yahoo users.  To send a single message to several of your friends, click 'Tools' -> 'Send Instant Message to Many' on the menu, then follow the instructions in the window that appears.  The window allows for messages up to 400 bytes to be sent friends and is NOT intended to be used as a spamming tool.  You may send your message to up to 8 users at one time.


</font><br>&nbsp; <br>

<font size="4" color="#0088AA"><b>
TUXVIRONMENTS AND AUDIBLES:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
TUXVironments are Gyach-E's interpretation of Yahoo's IMVironments (tm) backgrounds for PM conversations.  Audibles are animations with sound sent in PM conversations. If you would like to be able to use TUXVironments and Audibles, you must download and install the LATEST <b>'Media-Package'</b> file available in the <a  href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57756">Download Area</a>. Follow the <a href="http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/install.php">installation instructions</a> for information on how to install/update the Media package.  The Media package is separate from the rest of Gyach-E, so you can freely upgrade your Media package at anytime without necessarily having to upgrade all of Gyach-E. The <b>Photo TUXVironment</b> is a plugin which fully implements the Photo IMVironment(tm) available on the Windows version of Y! Messenger.  It allows you to share a photo album (and browse it together) with a friend in an instant messaging window. To use it, you must first go to <a href="http://photos.yahoo.com">http://photos.yahoo.com</a> and create one or more photo albums if you don't already have some created. (If you plan on sharing your own photos with another person.)  Note: I did NOT illegally decompile/disassemble the Windows version of the Photo IMVironment to make one for Gyach-E: The Gyach-E version is the result of network monitoring and old-fashioned trial and error.  If your copy of Gyach-E did not come with the Photo TUXVironment, you may obtain the plugin from the <a  href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57756">Download Area</a> and follow the <a href="http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/install.php">installation instructions</a>.

FLASH SUPPORT / FLASH PLAYER COMMAND:
</font></b><br><font size="4" color="#000000">
In the <b>'Setup'</b> window, you should see a configuration option named <b>'Flash Player Cmd'</b> on the <b>'Options'</b> tab.  This command is used mainly for playing avatar animations when you choose to view a buddy's avatar or your own avatar.  I personally recommend using the official stand-alone Flash player from Macromedia, called <b>gflashplayer</b>.  You can find <b>gflashplayer</b> at the following sites: <a href="http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/macromedia/tarball/generic/install_flash_player_6_linux_sa.tar.gz">http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/macromedia/tarball/generic/install_flash_player_6_linux_sa.tar.gz</a> and <a href="http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/macromedia/site_ru.html">http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/macromedia/site_ru.html</a> (look for the <b>'flash-gflashplayer'</b> package). These links lead to binary packages for Intel-based systems.  A less stable option is <b>'swf_play'</b>, available at the SWFDec website: <a href="http://swfdec.sourceforge.net/">http://swfdec.sourceforge.net/</a>. (Personally, I think that one needs PLENTY of work, and it appears to be 'unmaintained'.)

You really need to use a command-line player for this option, a player that does NOT require a user interface.  (In other words, avoid things like XMMS, since you probably don't want copies of XMMS popping open everytime somebody sends you an Audible.)  The 2 command-line players I recommend are: <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a>  and <a href="http://www.mpg123.de/">mpg123</a>. If you choose to use 'mplayer', I recommend you use a command like  <b>mplayer -ao esd -quiet</b>, as it will enable you to continue to hear Gyach Enhanced sound events even if an Audible is playing, and vice versa.
