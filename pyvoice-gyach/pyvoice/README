NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT
	NO Technical Support of ANY kind is provided for this application. You are ON 
	your own.  Can't get it to run on your system?  Too bad.  However, I will 
	accept bug reports and language translations.  And, a 'bug report' is NOT 
	'I can't get it to run...'.   ONLY send 'bug reports' if you can localize the problem 
	to one of the following:
		Network communications - UDP/TCP
		RTP or other network packet handling
		User interface problems
		TrueSpeech encoding/decoding problems
		ESound playback/recording problems
		Memory leaks
		Unexplained crashes that occur AFTER the pY! Voice Chat main window has 
		shown to the screen
	Errors of the type 'import error: no module named...' are NOT bugs, but problems 
	with your Python configuration and will be IGNORED if e-mailed to me.  Learn 
	about Python and installing Python modules properly at http://www.python.org. 
	They have lots of documentation: READ IT!  DO NOT e-mail me with questions 
	or problems with your Gtk or PyGtk configuration.




CONTENTS
	pyvoice.py  -  Network, RTP, and sound functionality library.
	pyvoiceui.py  -  Graphical user interface module.  (for Gtk-2/PyGtk-2)
	pyvoiceui-Gtk1.py  -  Graphical user interface module.  (for Gtk-1/PyGtk-1 - UNMAINTAINED)
	PyTSP -  library for reading/writing TrueSpeech sound data
	PyESD (embedded in PyTSP) - library for playing/recoring on ESound  (Enlightenment 
	Sound Daemon)

MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
	1. A COMPILED version of PyTSP (with the _pytsp.so library)
	2. PyGtk-2 (version 1.99/2.00) or PyGtk-1 (version 0.6.9), the default setup is to use PyGtk-2.  Please be aware that while, at last check, the PyGtk-1 interface was working, it is no longer maintained.  The PyGtk-2/Gtk-2 interface is 'pyvoiceui.py', and the old PyGtk-1 interface
is 'pyvoiceui-Gtk1.py'
	3. Python version 2.2 or better
	4. ESound (Enlightenment Sound Daemon) version 0.2.28 or better, needed by PyTSP. 
	    Other sound systems such as OSS, Alsa, SDL, and YIFF are NOT supported.
	    I do not use them. I think they suck.  I use ESound almost exclusively. I dislike Alsa 
	    and OSS and have no intention of adding support for sound systems I don't use.
	    So, either get ESound (most Gnome and IceWM users already have it), or adapt 
	    the PyTSP code to use the sound system you want, or move on.  DO NOT e-mail 
	    me requesting that I add support for other sound systems: I wrote this application 
	    for ME, so you can re-write it for YOU.
	5. A pY! Voice Chat-aware Yahoo chat client  (currently, the only one I 
	    know of is my own GYach Enhanced client.)
	6. The DSP Group TrueSpeech codecs  (tssoft32.acm, tsd32.dll) placed in the appropriate 
	    location, normal /usr/lib/win32, or /usr/local/lib/win32 - needed by PyTSP.  NOTE:
	    if these codecs are NOT in the right location, PyTSP (and pY! Voice Chat) will 
	    crash or fail to function properly.

ADDITIONAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
	If you need to recompile PyTSP for your system, execute './Build' in the pytsp 
	sub-directory.  You should see the 'README.pytsp' and 'README.pyesd' files 
	for more information on the system requirements for compiling the PyTSP library.

RUNNING pY! Voice Chat
	To run pY! Voice Chat, run the 'pyvoice' executable or the 'pyvoiceui.py' executable.
	If you get an error like "import error: no module named gtk...', (or GDK, or GTK, etc.) 
	it means you do NOT have PyGtk properly installed: This is YOUR problem, so do NOT 
	e-mail me about this.  NOTE: You should only run pY! Voice Chat after you have 
	join a Yahoo! chat room with voice chat enabled using a pY! Voice Chat-aware client 
	like GYach Enhanced. 

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
	Recording and sending sound to the Yahoo voice chat servers does work; however, 
	many people have reported the mic sounds like it 'breaks up' alot.  I'm working on this.
	Voice chat for PMs and private conference rooms (not regular chat rooms) is still 
	considered very experimental.  When quitting pY! Voice Chat, you may see 'Gtk Critical' 
	warnings on the console - these are harmless, but they are ugly.  I'm working on it.

I MAKE no guarantee that I will make future releases of pY! Voice Chat.  It's very possible that this may be the first, last and only release of pY! Voice Chat, as my intentions are to be generous enough to show people HOW to connect to Yahoo's voice chat servers, but after that, I plan on just maintaining my personal copy of the code.  Everybody else may very well be on their own.  (This means, if Yahoo changes the protocol and you can't connect anymore - FIX your code instead of whining to me, I'll only be maintaining my own copy.) However, I will definitely be willing to release language translations anyone wishes to contribute.

TRANSLATIONS
	Currently pY! Voice Chat supports 2 languages: English and Spanish.  If you are 
	familiar with gettext, you may make new language translations using the 'pyvoice.pot' 
	translation catalogue in the './locale/' sub-directory.  Your translated catalogue 
	should be placed in the appropriate sub-directory of the './locale/' directory. The 
	'appropriate sub-directory' is the lower-case of the first 2 letters of your locale name: 
	Examples:  
		locale: 'es_MX' ->  directory: 'es'
		locale: 'ru_RU' ->  directory: 'ru'
	If you wish to have your language translation added to pY! Voice Chat, send your 
	UNCOMPILED 'pyvoice.po' file in a .gz, .zip, .tar.gz, or .tar.bz2 file to:
		PhrozenSmoke [-AT-] yahoo.com
	Also, corrections to the Spanish translation are welcomed.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (Well...potentially):

	Where can I get the TrueSpeech codecs?
		A copy of the codecs should be included with the PyTSP library included
		with pY! Voice Chat.  However, you can grab them off most Windows 
		computers in the C:\windows or C:\windows\system directories.  Also,
		you can check the pY! Voice Chat web site
		(http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/) and the MPlayer 
		web site (http://www.mplayerhq.hu).

	Why TrueSpeech?
		Because it's what Yahoo uses to send/receive voice chat communications.

	Why ESound? (and not Alsa, SDL, OSS, YIFF, etc....)
		Because I use ESound and I wrote this application to please ME, not 
		the rest of the world.

	Where can I get ESound?
		Try the FTP site for the 'gnome.org' site if you need the source for ESound 
		(aka 'esd').

	Where can I get PyGtk?
		Google it!  I think it's on the 'gnome.org' site for the source package, and 
		www.rpmfind.net for binary packages.

	Where can I get Gtk+?
		www.gtk.org

	Where can I get 'GYach Enhanced'?
		  http://phpaint.sourceforge.net/pyvoicechat/

	Can I use other Yahoo chat clients with pY! Voice Chat?
		Sure, if you re-write them to work with pY! Voice Chat?

	Why isn't pY! Voice Chat written in C/C++?
		I think both languages suck and are past their prime, and I use as little of both 
		possible.  Their error-catching sucks, leading to nasty crashes, since both 
		seem to assume that a HUMAN programmer knows how to write a program 
		with NO human errors (impossible).  I'm not among the arrogant who believe 
		any human can write a bug-free program, so I prefer Python because of its
		strong error-catching capabilities.  Also, Python programs crash MUCH less 
		than C/C++.   Also, in Python I can do in 5 lines what it may take 
		15-20 lines to do in C/C++.  Those languages are too inefficiently structurally 
		for what I was trying to do:  Get a voice chat app up and running FAST.  If 
		I had my way, the whole setup would be re-written in Python, from GYach 
		Enhanced right down to PyESD and PyTSP.

	But C/C++ is FAST!
		So is death due to a snapped bungee cord: That doesn't make the 
		idea a FAVORABLE one.

	Any plans to re-write pY! Voice Chat in another programming language?
		Such as C, C++, Perl?   NOPE.

	Any plans to port pY! Voice Chat to PyGtk for Gtk+2?
		YUP.  When I get good and damn ready.  8-)  Honestly, I would like 
		both GYach Enhanced and pY! Voice Chat to be using the same GUI, so 
		pY! Voice Chat will be ported to PyGtk-2/Gtk-2 when I feel the 
		FUNCTIONALITY of pY! Voice Chat is more stable and I find the time 
		to upgrade from PyGtk-1 to PyGtk-2 (whenever that will be).
