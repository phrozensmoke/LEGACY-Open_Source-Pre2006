%description
A highly enhanced, feature-rich fork of the original Gyach chat program. The ENHANCED version of GYach includes many of the features one would expect to see on the Windows Yahoo client, hopefully without the bugs.  It is a complete renovation of the original Gyach program and also includes voice chat and webcam support.  This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License, and NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT is offered.  This package includes both the external voice chat program, pYVoiceChat, and the external webcam programs, GyachE-Webcam and pYWebCam. In addition, this package includes GyachE-Broadcaster for sending webcam streams.
