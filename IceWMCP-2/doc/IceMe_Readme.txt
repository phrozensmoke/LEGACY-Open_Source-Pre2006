The version of IceMe included with IceWM Control Panel is based on IceMe 1.0.0, but with SERIOUS enhancements. 

Many may be wondering while IceWM Control Panel uses IceMe   (IceWMCP Special Edition), when version 1.1.1 of the original IceMe is available.  Well, I personally tested IceMe 1.1.1 and found several bugs in the software, namely  several start-up problems, violent crashes when images failed to load, problems reading menu files with menu entries outside of the 'Programs' area, and writing of corrupted menu files due to misreading of the menu.  I did not feel that the latest release of the original IceMe (1.1.1) was stable enough for inclusion in the latest IceWM Control Panel.  Instead, I included the IceMe 'Special Edition', which has many of the new features of the latest IceMe, with the stability of IceMe 1.0.0. IceMe 'IceWMCP Special Edition' is a modified version, not created or endorsed by the current maintainer of the official IceMe software.  See the 'CHANGES.txt' file for a list of the features, changes, and improvments in the 'Special Edition' of IceMe included in IceWM Control Panel.
