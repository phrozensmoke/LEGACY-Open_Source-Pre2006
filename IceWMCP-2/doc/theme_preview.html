Theme previewing is a new feature of IcePref2 (an updated version of IcePref, improved by Erica Andrews [PhrozenSmoke [at] yahoo.com]). <br><br>

Theme previewing requires a JPEG image named 'preview.jpg' in each theme's directory. If your theme is in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/themes/nice/, then your preview JPEG should be at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/themes/nice/preview.jpg (the name MUST be 'preview.jpg'). <br><br>

The image should be no larger in size than 200x200 pixels, and no smaller than 100x100 pixels. (any variations in between should be fine (150x170, 175x190, etc.).  The 'preview.jpg' image should be a screenshot of IceWM running with that particular theme. You do NOT need a large screenshot of the theme - in fact, large screenshots (over 200x200 pixels in size) are discouraged, as it will only slow down theme previewing in IcePref. The image must be in JPEG format. All images (no matter their size) will be scaled to approximatedly 200 pixels in width. <br><br>

The easiest way to get 'preview' images for your themes is to click the 'Create Theme Preview...' button in IcePref2, under 'Themes'.  This feature requires the 'import' binary from ImageMagick.<br><br>

Other than that, there are three ways to get 'preview' images for your themes: <br>
[1] Download the package of (some) theme previews from my site: <a href="http://icesoundmanager.sourceforge.net/IcePref2/theme_previews.tar.gz">[theme_previews.tar.gz] (157   kb - contains 31 'preview.jpg' files for popular themes).</a> 
<br>[2] Use the theme thumbnails at  <a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/925/?topic_id=925">http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/925/?topic_id=925</a> (The Freshmeat IceWM themes section) 
<br>[3] Make the preview images yourself with scaled screenshots.  <br><br>

THEME AUTHORS: Theme authors are encouraged to add 'preview.jpg' preview files to their distributed theme packages. This is a good idea, as it will start making themes previewable in IceWM, without much trouble to the end-user.
