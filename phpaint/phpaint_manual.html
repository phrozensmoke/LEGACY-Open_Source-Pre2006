<p><a NAME="overview"></a><b>Overview:</b>
<blockquote>PHPaint is intended for the easy creation, editing, and previewing of "buttons" for web pages. The hope is to greatly ease the Web Developer's task of creating "buttons" for web pages, allowing them to move on to more important tasks. If you are trying to build a web "frontend" to a big database, do you REALLY have time to fiddle with image editors to created "buttons"? No. PHPaint is NOT intended to be an all-purpose image editor for ordinary desktop users. It is intended for Web Developers (probably PHP developers) who are interested in speeding up the process of creating the actual user interface for a web site. PHPaint uses PHP, the GD Library, and the FreeType module, technologies familiar to most PHP developers. Most people using the GD/Freetype modules create image scripts
that don't allow such things as the colors, font, font size, and padding
to be changed <b>without</b> having to change the image script itself.&nbsp;
This is fine if you want to create a set of uniform images, only changing
the text.&nbsp; However, these kinds of image scripts aren't very useful
if you need to create a number of images with different fonts, colors,
font sizes, etc.&nbsp; It is also not very fun having to continuously re-edit
the image script to find the best-looking colors.&nbsp; PHPaint allows
you to use <b><u>one</u></b> PHP script for all of the images you create
with GD and FreeType.&nbsp; The program comes with a re-usable image script
that allows for <b>complete</b> control over the colors, font, font size,
and padding without ever having to change the script itself.&nbsp; All
of the images characteristics are controlled through the IMG tag, which
is automatically generated by PHPaint for each new image you create.&nbsp;
Simply copy and paste the generate IMG tags into your page, put the re-usable
script into the same web server directory as your web page(s), and your images are
done.&nbsp; The program also allows you to preview your images with any
color background in real-time.&nbsp; PHPaint uses PHP4 and Javascript technologies.&nbsp;

<p><br><a NAME="require"></a><b>System
Requirements:</b>
<blockquote>
<b>PHPaint requires the following to work properly:</b><br>
- A web server that can execute PHP scripts (Apache, IIS, whatever)<br>
- PHP (version 4.0b1 or better required, 4.12 or better recommended) installed on the web server<br>
- The GD Library (version 1.73 or better) for PHP<br>
- The FreeType module for PHP<br>
- Your version of PHP must be capable of producing <u>at least one</u> of these image types: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WBMP<br>
- Some TrueType (.ttf) fonts to use (PHPaint comes with only 2 fonts)
- One of the supported web browsers (below)<br><a name="browser"><br>

<b>Supported Web Browers:</b><br>
- Netscape 4.75 or later<br>
- Opera 5 or later<br>
- Internet Explorer 5 or later<br><br>


I would reasonably assume that PHPaint should work with most recent versions of Mozilla-based browsers besides Netscape (Galeon, etc.). However, this has not been tested and cannot be guaranteed to work.<br><br>

PHPaint has successfully run on <a href="#tested">both Linux and Windows</a>. PHPaint <u>should</u> run on any operating system meeting the requirements above (theoretically), but this has NOT been tested and can't be guaranteed.<br><br>

In addition, if you are going to be using PHPaint to created WBMP (Wireless Bitmap) images, I recommend you have a Wireless/WAP-enabled web browser or image viewer handy, as most normal web browsers cannot display WBMP images.

<p><br><a NAME="installation"></a><b>Installation:</b>
<blockquote>Installation is very simple.&nbsp;
Just <a href="http://phpaint.sourceforge.net" target="download">download</a> and unzip the PHPaint archive into one of your web server's directories. I suggest you unzip (or un-tar) the archive into your web server's root directory, allowing the archive to automatically created a 'phpaint' directory. 
&nbsp; After the files have been unzipped, just
visit:<br><br>&nbsp; http://Your.Server.Com/Your_Directory/<b>phpaint.php</b>&nbsp;<br><br> 
with one of the <a href="#browser">supported web browsers</a>. &nbsp; For most people, the URL will be something like 'http://www.myserver.com/phpaint/phpaint.php' . <br><br>Then, <a href="phpaint_tutorial.html" target="tut">follow the tutorial</a> to get started quickly.</blockquote>


<p><br><a NAME="tested"></a><b>Where
Has PHPaint Been Tested:</b>
<blockquote>Currently, PHP has been tested in two environments:<br><br>
Most recently, on Mandrake Linux 8.2, running Apache 1.3.23, PHP 4.12, GD (1.83 - I think), and a recent version of the FreeType module for PHP, using Netscape 4.75 and Opera 5.<br><br>A while ago: running Windows 
98 with IIS 4, PHP 4.05/4.06, the GD Library (1.73 - 1.83), with the FreeType
module support, using Internet Explorer
5.<br><br>
I can't comment on other browsers and server setups.
